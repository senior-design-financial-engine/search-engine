        "date": "February 21, 2025",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks fell sharply Friday after reports showed that worries among consumers and businesses about President Donald Trump’s policies may be hitting the U.S. economy. The S&P 500 sank 1.7% for its worst day in two months. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 748 points, or 1.7%, and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 2.2%. The losses accelerated through the day following several weaker-than-expected reports on the economy. One suggested U.S. business activity is close to stalling , with growth slowing to a 17-month low. The preliminary report from S&P Global said activity unexpectedly shrank for U.S. services businesses, and many in the survey reported slumping optimism because of worries about Washington. “Companies report widespread concerns about the impact of federal government policies, ranging from spending cuts to tariffs and geopolitical developments,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence. “Sales are reportedly being hit by the uncertainty caused by the changing political landscape, and prices are rising amid tariff-related price hikes from suppliers.” A separate report said U.S. consumers are also preparing for higher inflation , in part because of potential tariffs that could raise prices for all kinds of imports. They’re broadly expecting prices to be 4.3% higher 12 months from now, which is a big jump from their forecast of 3.3% inflation last month, according to a survey by the University of Michigan. That fits with preliminary data in the survey earlier this month. Among U.S. households, though, a divide is evident underneath the surface. Expectations for inflation are rising for political independents and Democrats, while falling slightly for Republicans.  A third economic report, meanwhile, said sales of previously occupied homes were weaker last month than economists expected. Relatively high mortgage rates , along with expensive prices for homes, have been hurting sales. To be sure, the U.S. stock market is still up for the young year so far and is not far from its all-time high set earlier this week. Virtually no one on Wall Street is forecasting a recession anytime soon. But Friday’s reports raise concerns about what’s been a remarkably resilient economy, and the losses on Wall Street were widespread. Stocks of the smallest companies, whose profits can be more closely tied to the strength of the U.S. economy than big multinational rivals, fell more than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 index of small stocks dropped a market-leading 2.9%. Within the big companies of the S&P 500 index, 3 out of every 4 stocks fell. Everything from Big Tech stocks that have been bid up amid the artificial-intelligence frenzy to airlines to metals companies dropped. Nvidia sank 4.1%. United Airlines lost 6.4%, and Newmont Mining fell 5.7%. Akamai Technologies had the sharpest drop in the S&P 500, even though the cybersecurity and cloud computing company reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It lost a fifth of its value and fell 21.7% as investors focused instead on its forecasts for revenue and other financial measures this upcoming year, which fell short of analysts’ expectations. On the winning side of Wall Street was Celsius Holdings, which sells “better-for-you” energy drinks. It leaped 27.8% after saying it agreed to buy Alani Nu, a beverage company that focuses on female customers. Analysts called the purchase price, $1.65 billion net of tax effects, reasonable and said the deal should quickly add to profits for Celsius, which also reported its latest quarterly results. Other winners included stocks of companies that can provide steadier profits regardless of the U.S. economy’s strength. Water utility American Water Works rose 3.1%, for example. All told, the S&P 500 fell 104.39 points to 6,013.13. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 748.63 to 43,428.02, and the Nasdaq composite sank 438.36 points to 19,524.01. Before Friday’s sharp drop, the S&P 500 had been heading for a week of almost zero movement. Helping to lift stocks had been a steady parade of better-than-expected profit reports. That helped offset worries about stubbornly high inflation , which could prevent the Federal Reserve from delivering more relief for the economy and financial markets through lower interest rates. The Fed has been holding its main interest rate steady after sharply cutting it through the end of last year. At their last policy meeting in January , Fed officials suggested they may stay on hold for a while given worries about how Trump’s proposed tariffs and mass deportations of migrants, along with other factors, could push upward on inflation. While lower rates can boost the economy, they can also encourage spending that puts upward pressure on inflation. Treasury yields fell in the bond market following Friday’s weaker-than-expected economic reports. The yield on the 10-year Treasury sank to 4.42 % from 4.51% late Thursday. In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed in Europe after rising across much of Asia. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng jumped 4% for one of the world’s largest moves,, boosted by a surge for e-commerce firm Alibaba , which reported stronger profit for the end of last year than expected. It also talked up its artificial-intelligence developments. AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed."

        "headline": "Germany’s economy is in the dumps. Here are 5 reasons why",
        "date": "February 17, 2025",
        "content": "Follow AP’s live coverage of the election in Germany . FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Germany hasn’t seen significant economic growth in five years. It’s a stunning turnaround for Europe’s biggest economy , which for much of this century had expanded exports and dominated world trade in engineered products like industrial machinery and luxury cars. So what happened? Here are five reasons for Germany’s ongoing economic slump : Moscow’s decision to cut off natural gas supplies to Germany in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine dealt a severe blow. For years, Germany’s business model was based on cheap energy fueling production of industrial goods for export. In 2011, then-Chancellor Angela Merkel decided to hasten the end of nuclear power use in Germany while relying on gas from Russia to bridge the gap as the country moved away from coal generation and toward renewable energy. Russia was then considered to be a reliable energy partner; warnings to the contrary from Poland and the United States were dismissed. When Russia discontinued the flow, prices in Germany skyrocketed for gas and for electricity generated from gas, both key costs for energy-intensive industries such as steel, fertilizer, chemicals and glass. Germany had to turn to liquefied natural gas, or LNG, super-cooled and imported by ship from Qatar and the U.S. LNG costs more than pipeline gas. Electricity now costs industrial users in Germany an average of 20.3 euro cents per kilowatt hour, according to a study the research firm Prognos AG prepared for the Bavarian Industry Association. In the U.S. and China, where many competitors of German companies are located, the cost is the equivalent of 8.4 euro cents. Renewable sources of energy haven’t scaled up fast enough to fill the gap. Homeowner and regional resistance to turbines slowed wind energy growth. Infrastructure to transport hydrogen as a replacement fuel for steel furnaces remains mostly on the drawing board. For years, Germany benefited from China’s entry into the global economy - even as other developed countries lost jobs to China. German companies found a massive new market for industrial machinery, chemicals and vehicles. Through the early and mid 2010s, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen and BMW reaped fat profits selling into what became the world’s largest car market. At the time, Chinese companies produced items like furniture and consumer electronics that didn’t compete with Germany’s core strengths. Then, manufacturers in China started making the same things that Germans did. State-subsidized Chinese solar panels wiped out Germany’s makers. In 2010, Chinese panel makers depended on imported German equipment; today, global solar panel production relies on equipment from China. The government in Beijing has ramped up efforts to promote and subsidize manufacturing for export. The resulting goods — steel, machinery, solar panels, electric vehicles and EV batteries — now compete with German goods on export markets. Germany, the most auto-centric of the European Union economies , had the most to lose from China’s export-oriented industrial policy. In 2020, China was not a net exporter of vehicles; by 2024, it was exporting 5 million a year. Germany’s net exports fell by half over the same period, to 1.2 million cars. Chinese factory capacity is estimated at 50 million vehicles a year, roughly half of global demand. Germany grew complacent during the good times and put off investing in long-term projects such as rail lines and high-speed internet. The government balanced its budget and sometimes ran surpluses off the tax revenue from a booming economy. These days, German commuters shake their heads at trains that don’t run on time and constant service disruptions while repairs are made to worn-out tracks. High speed internet hasn’t yet reached some rural areas. A transmission line to bring electricity from Germany’s windy north to factories in the south has run years behind and won’t be ready before 2028. A key bridge on the highway connecting the industrial Ruhr region with southern Germany had to be closed in 2021, 10 years after doubts about its durability emerged. A replacement won’t be ready before 2027. A 2009 constitutional amendment handcuffed the government by limiting deficit spending. Whether to loosen the so-called debt brake will be a thorny issue for the German government installed after the country’s Feb. 23 election. German companies are having trouble finding workers with the right skills, from highly trained IT workers to daycare providers, senior care workers and hotel staff members. In a German Chamber of Commerce and Industry survey of 23,000 firms, 43% of companies said they couldn’t fill open positions. The response rose to 58% for companies with more than 1,000 workers. Fewer German students are interested in STEM fields, meaning science, technology, engineering and mathematics. An aging population compounds the problem, as does a shortage of affordable child care that keeps many women working part-time or not at all. Bureaucratic hurdles pose an obstacle to employing high-skill immigrants , though a law passed in 2020 and strengthened in 2023 aims to ease the process. Lengthy approval procedures and too much paperwork are a drag on the economy , according to Germany companies and economists. Securing a construction permit for a wind turbine can take years. A few other examples, among dozens raised by German business groups: — Companies installing solar panels need to register with both government regulators and their local utility even though the utility could pass on the information to the government level. — Restaurants have to log refrigerator temperatures by hand and keep hard copies of the records for a month even if the data has been stored digitally. — A law requiring companies to certify that their suppliers are obeying environmental and labor standards went beyond EU requirements, putting a heavier burden on German companies than their European competitors."

        "date": "February 17, 2025",
        "content": "MULFINGEN, Germany (AP) — Germany needs a new business model . The old one, fueled by cheap natural gas from Russia and lucrative exports to China, is broken, leaving Europe’s biggest economy mired in stagnation and angst about the future. Delivering that fresh growth strategy is going to be the biggest challenge for the government that takes office after a national election set for Feb. 23, seven months ahead of schedule. The nation that became known for the quality of its products has not seen real economic growth for five years. Multiple factors conspired to take Germany from industrial powerhouse to post-pandemic straggler: too much bureaucracy, a shortage of skilled workers , slow deployment of technology and a lack of clear direction from the outgoing coalition government are among them. Rising competition from China and high energy prices due to Russia’s war in Ukraine were additional hits. “We really need a more company- and enterprise-friendly politics,” said Klaus Geissdoerfer, CEO of industrial fan manufacturer EBM-Papst. “We have bright talent in Germany. We have good companies, but at the moment we don’t have the awareness on the political level.”  With 2.5 billion euros ($2.6 billion) in annual revenue and plants on three continents, EBM-Papst describes itself as the global leader in its field. The company reported last year that it was “suffering in Germany in particular” and experienced a 4.1% revenue decline in its home market. Geissdoerfer said EBM-Papst’s heating technology division lost 18.7% of its sales through a clumsily handled push to get property owners to replace gas furnaces with less polluting electric heat pumps. The requirements of the Building Energy Act put forward by Chancellor Olaf Scholz’ three-party coalition were so confusing, people put off the upgrades to their heating systems or rushed to buy new gas devices before the law took effect, he said. That sapped demand for the ultra-quiet heat pump fans EBM-Papst makes. Consumers wondered, “What is the right technology for my house?” Geissdoerfer said. “And so everybody said, ‘If I don’t have to, I better wait.’” Geissdoerfer made a complaint heard across industry : Germany’s bureaucracy is excessive. A 2023 law that requires public and private entities to combat climate change by reducing their energy use means EBM-Papst must assign employees to detail what the company is doing to comply, he said. “So now, instead of implementing measures, they write and report,” the CEO said, adding that the documentation work is a poor use of time at a company whose core business is energy-saving equipment. “I really hope with the new government we can get this solved, because at the moment it’s too much.” EBM-Papst is moving in the direction where economists say Germany as a whole should put its industrial resources: into green and digital technology. The company, headquartered in Mulfingen, a town of 3,700 residents in rural southwest Germany, is equipping energy-hungry artificial intelligence data centers with efficient cooling systems for their servers. It also is working on incorporating AI features to help tech companies optimize their power use and to predict when equipment needs to be replaced. In the meantime, EBM-Papst is coping with Germany’s economic malaise by shifting its investment focus to Asia and the United States. The company now supplies U.S. customers, for instance, from plants in Farmington, Connecticut,and Telford, Tennessee. Its moves to localize production abroad predate the coronavirus pandemic but give EBM-Papst a shield against any new import taxes imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump . On top of the homegrown issues, international relations have dealt another blow. Russia cut off most of the country’s natural gas supplies over the German government’s wartime support for Ukraine . Electricity prices , a key cost for industry, have risen to 2 1/2 times higher than in the U.S. and China. Metalworking firm Mecanindus-Vogelsang Group, which makes precision parts for automakers and other manufacturers, says it pays twice as much per kilowatt hour for the electricity its German plants use as it does for its U.S. sites in Mt. Sterling, Kentucky, and Lakewood, New Jersey. That’s 100,000 euros in added costs and “a gigantic competitive disadvantage” CEO Ulrich Flatken said. “To avoid deindustrialization, which is already taking place, we urgently need internationally competitive energy prices,” Flatken said. Another shock came from China, which throughout the 2010s served as a lucrative market for German-made machinery and automobiles. Once Chinese companies started making those same products, backed by government subsidies, German exports suffered. Germany’s economy contracted in each of the last two years . By the end of 2024, it was only 0.3% bigger than it was in 2019, before the pandemic. The U.S. economy grew by 11.4% during over the same period, while China’s expanded by 25.8%, according to Germany’s Federal Statistical Office. Marcel Fratzscher, president of the German Institute for Economic Research, thinks complacency set in during the boom years of exports to China. German companies weren’t quick enough to respond to technological trends, such as the move to electric cars , he said. “They enjoyed the success of the 2010s and they have been too slow in understanding that they need to change and adapt,” Fratzscher said. As the economic woes drag on, “mental depression” has set in, he said. “The pessimism is enormous among companies and citizens, and that’s an important explanation why companies are not investing.” Many business executives and economists argue that Germany’s next government should work to loosen constitutional limits on debt so it can increase public spending on infrastructure and education. Fratzscher wonders if political leaders , like the economy, will falter in adopting new ways of doing things. “For the past 75 years, Germany has been built very much on consensus, stability oriented, lots of checks and balances in the political system, and that makes rapid change very difficult,” he said. “We need to change the mindset, to understand we need to be much faster on economic transformations.”"

        "content": "TOKYO (AP) — Japan’s economy grew at a better-than-expected annual rate of 2.8% in October-December, underlined by steady exports and moderate consumption. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, the world’s fourth largest economy grew 0.7% for its third straight quarter of growth, the Cabinet Office reported Monday in its preliminary data. For 2024, the Japanese economy eked out 0.1% growth in seasonally adjusted real GDP, or gross domestic product, which measures the value of a nation’s product and service. That’s the fourth straight year of expansion. Private consumption grew at an annual rate of 0.5% during the three months through December, holding up while losing momentum. Exports jumped 4.3%, and capital investment increased 0.5%. The positive data sent Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 higher, as well as other Asian markets. Some analysts think the anticipation of President Donald Trump’s tariffs may have lifted trade. Unlike the U.S. and some other nations, Japan has been dogged by deflation, and these lower prices stifle growth. But recent wage growth has kept deflationary trends in check. Recent data show inflation is at about the Bank of Japan’s target of 2%. Higher prices are crimping consumer spending, which makes up for more than half the economy. The central bank may move to further raise interest rates, which were at zero or below zero for years to wrest the economy out of deflation. It raised its key interest rate to about 0.5% from 0.25% last month, noting that inflation is holding at a desirable target level. The next monetary policy meeting is in March. “Stronger growth may reinforce expectations for the Bank of Japan to push through with further hikes, while the slowdown in private consumption growth may be addressed by the prospects of higher wages ahead,” said Yeap Jun Rong, market strategist at IG."

        "date": "February 13, 2025",
        "content": "LONDON (AP) — The British economy managed to eke out a quarterly growth of 0.1% in the final quarter of 2024 following a stronger than anticipated performance in December. The Office for National Statistics said Thursday that the 0.4% expansion in December was a result of a broad-based expansion, with pubs doing particularly well in the run-up to Christmas. The fourth quarter figures means the economy grew by 0.9% overall in 2024. The quarterly increase followed no growth in the previous three months and may ease some of the pressure on Treasury chief Rachel Reeves, who critics say has been partly responsible for the economic slowdown since Labour returned to power in July. Last week, the Bank of England halved its growth forecast for the British economy for 2025 to 0.75% as it cut its main interest rate to 4.5%. If that turns out to be remotely accurate, it will be hugely disappointing news for the U.K.’s new Labour government, which has made growth its top mission The party has pledged to boost living standards and generate funds for cash-starved public services. With growth proving elusive, the party’s popularity has fallen sharply since its election victory in July. In recent weeks, Reeves has set out plans to boost longer-term growth, such as backing a third runway at London’s Heathrow Airport. She has also pledged to create a Silicon Valley-like technology hub between the two university towns of Oxford and Cambridge, backed the regeneration of the area around Manchester United’s Old Trafford soccer stadium, as well as a “reset” of the U.K.’s post-Brexit economic relations with the European Union. Reeves said the government will go “further and faster” to bolster growth in the months and years ahead. “That is why we are taking on the blockers to get Britain building again, investing in our roads, rail and energy infrastructure, and removing the barriers that get in the way of businesses who want to expand,” she said."

        "date": "February 07, 2025",
        "content": "LONDON (AP) — The Bank of England halved its growth projection for the British economy this year as it cut its main interest rate Thursday for the third time in six months. In a statement, the bank’s nine-member Monetary Policy Committee lowered its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.50%, taking it to its lowest level since mid-2023. That decision was widely expected in financial markets. What wasn’t expected was the scale of the growth downgrade in the bank’s accompanying economic forecasts. The bank now predicts that the British economy will only grow by 0.75% this year, down from its previous forecast of 1.5% just three months ago. If that turns out to be remotely accurate, it will be hugely disappointing news for the U.K.'s new Labour government, which has made growth its number one mission as it will boost living standards and generate funds for cash-starved public services. With growth proving elusive, the party’s popularity has fallen sharply since its election victory in July. Treasury chief Rachel Reeves, who faced criticism for raising taxes on business in her first budget last October, welcomed the interest rate cut but said she was “still not satisfied with the growth rate” and that the government will go “faster to kickstart economic growth.” The government will no doubt be hoping that the central bank helps it out by cutting interest rates further over coming months as it will contribute to lower mortgage rates and cheaper loans, though reducing the returns offered to savers.  Financial markets remain uncertain as to how many additional reductions there will be this year as the bank is also forecasting higher than anticipated inflation over the coming few months — it expects inflation to hit 3.7% sometime in the first half of the year, before drifting back towards its target rate of 2%. Given that growth and inflation backdrop, Bank Gov. Andrew Bailey said the outlook for the British economy remained uncertain, and could get more uncertain if U.S. President Donald Trump goes through with his tariff threats. “We’ll be monitoring the U.K. economy and global developments very closely and taking a gradual and careful approach to reducing rates further,” Baily said. “Low and stable inflation is the foundation of a healthy economy and it’s the Bank of England’s job to ensure that.” A major surprise in Thursday’s rate decision was that two of the nine members of the panel voted for an even bigger reduction of half a percentage point to 4.25%. Luke Bartholomew, deputy chief economist at abrdn, formerly Aberdeen Asset Management, said the fact two did vote for a bigger cut “gives a sense of how concerned some policymakers are about the headwinds to growth.” The rate-setting panel doesn’t directly target growth as its remit is to ensure that inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index, hits a 2% target over the coming couple years or so. However, lower growth can keep inflation in check as it is an indication of lower demand in the economy. Though inflation is standing at 2.5% and expected to rise in coming months, partly as a result of business tax increases from the new Labour government, most economists think it will then trend lower towards the target, hence the panel’s ability to cut on Thursday. Inflation is way down from levels seen a couple of years ago, partly because central banks have dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the coronavirus pandemic. Prices then began to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues and later because of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine , which pushed energy costs higher. As inflation rates have declined from multidecade highs, central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve have started cutting interest rates, though few, if any, economists think that rates will fall back to the super-low levels that persisted in the years after the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 and during the pandemic."

        "date": "January 30, 2025",
        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A humming American economy ended 2024 on a solid note with consumer spending continuing to drive growth, and ahead of what could be a significant change in direction under a Trump administration. The Commerce Department reported Thursday that gross domestic product — the economy’s output of goods and services — expanded at a 2.3% annual rate from October through December. For the full year, the economy grew a healthy 2.8%, compared with 2.9% in 2023. The fourth-quarter growth was a tick below the 2.4% economists had expected, according to a survey of forecasters by the data firm FactSet.  Consumer spending grew at a 4.2% pace, fastest since January-March 2023 and up from 3.7% in July-September last year. But business investment tumbled as investment in equipment plunged after two straight strong quarters. Wednesday’s report also showed persistent inflationary pressure at the end of the 2024. The Federal Reserve’s favored inflation gauge — called the personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE — rose at a 2.3% annual pace last quarter, up from 1.5% in the third quarter and above the Fed’s 2% target. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core PCE inflation was 2.5%, up from 2.2% in the July-September quarter. A drop in business inventories shaved 0.93 percentage points off fourth-quarter growth. But a category within the GDP data that measures the economy’s underlying strength rose at a healthy 3.2% annual rate from July through September, slipping from 3.4% in the third quarter. This category includes consumer spending and private investment but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending.  Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said that figure “suggests the economy remains strong, particularly given the fourth-quarter disruptions,’' including a strike at Boeing and the aftermath of two hurricanes. President Donald Trump has inherited a healthy economy. Growth has been steady and unemployment low — 4.1% in December. The economy has proven remarkably resilient after the Fed’s inflation fighters raised rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023 to combat the biggest surge in consumer prices since the 1980s. Instead of sliding into a recession, as most economists predicted, GDP kept expanding. Growth has now topped 2% in nine of the last 10 quarters. On Wednesday, the Fed left its benchmark interest rate unchanged after making three cuts since September. With the economy rolling along, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters, “we do not need to be in a hurry’’ to make more cuts. The Fed is also cautious because progress against inflation has stalled in recent months after falling from four-decade highs hit in mid-2022. The European Central Bank cut its benchmark rate by a quarter point Thursday, underlining the contrast between more robust growth in the U.S. economy and stagnation in Europe, which recorded zero growth at the end of last year. The U.S. economic outlook has become more cloudy, however. Trump has promised to cut taxes and ease regulations on business, which could speed GDP growth. But his plan to impose big taxes on imports and to deport millions of immigrants working in the United States illegally could mean slower growth and higher prices. Trump said last week that he would lower oil prices and then “demand’’ lower interest rates – a topic he said he’d take up with Powell. But the Fed chair deflected questions about Trump’s comments Wednesday and said he’d had no contact with the president. Trump has also tried to reshape the federal government, offering buyouts to workers and issuing a memo Monday night freezing federal grants, then rescinding the memo Wednesday after a public outcry. Citing the “squeeze’’ on the federal government, Ashworth wrote in a commentary, ”we wouldn’t be surprised to see a reversal in the first quarter. As a starting point, we expect first-quarter GDP growth to slow marginally below 2%.’' Thursday’s GDP release was the first of three Commerce Department estimates of October-December growth."

        "content": "FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The European Central Bank cut its key interest rate on Thursday to boost an economy that’s struggling to grow as consumers burned by inflation warily eye price tags and businesses try to navigate political turmoil in leading economies France and Germany . The cut comes a day after the U.S. Federal Reserve held off on reducing rates , underlining the contrast between more robust growth in the U.S. economy and stagnation in Europe, which recorded zero growth at the end of last year. The ECB’s governing council lowered its benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point to 2.75% at a meeting at its skyscraper headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany. ECB President Christine Lagarde said that “the disinflation process is well on track” and that inflation would fall to the bank’s 2% target “in the course of this year.” She said ECB rate cuts would support growth. “The economy is still facing headwinds but rising real incomes and the gradually fading effects of restrictive monetary policy should support a pick-up in demand over time,” she said. Thursday’s was the fourth rate cut in a row, and the fifth from the record benchmark high of 4%. Worries about growth have overtaken overtaking anxiety about inflation. Inflation is down from its peak of 10.6% in October 2022, although it is still somewhat above target at 2.4% in December on higher energy prices. Europe’s economy stagnated at the end of last year as its former growth engine, Germany , finished a second straight year of shrinking output. Gross domestic product in the 20-country eurozone showed a zero increase in the final quarter of 2024, the EU statistics agency Eurostat said. For the full year, the economy grew 0.7%.  The economy slowed from 0.4% growth in the third quarter as businesses were unsettled by possible trade disruptions under the new administration of U.S. President Donald Trump . Consumers remained cautious about spending after being stung by inflation, even though inflation has come down from its peak of 10.6% in October 2022. By contrast the U.S. economy grew 0.6% in the fourth quarter for an annual rate of 2.3%. Germany is laboring under multiple headwinds including the loss of cheap energy from Russia, choking bureaucracy and political paralysis in Berlin. Its economy contracted 0.2% in the fourth quarter. The German economy, Europe’s largest, also contracted 0.2% for all of 2024, the second straight year of declining output. And the outlook for this year isn’t much better. The government slashed its 2025 forecast on Wednesday to 0.3% from 1.1%. Leading European economies Germany and France are both unsettled by political turmoil that has left businesses and consumers uncertain about what the future holds in terms of government spending, regulation and taxes. Germany’s political confusion could clear up after a national election on Feb. 23 following the collapse of Social Democratic Chancellor Olaf Scholz’ governing coalition, which had been mired in months of bickering over what to do about the economy. France may take longer to emerge from paralysis, since the parliament is deeply divided and a new election can’t be held until July at the earliest. Political forces are at odds over how to address the country’s large budget deficit. Business prospects have been unsettled by the election of Trump, whose advocacy of new and higher import tariffs could hurt Europe’s export-oriented economy. Slowing uptake of electric vehicles and Germany’s cancellation of purchase subsidies for EVs has hurt demand for parts suppliers. Measures of consumer optimism such as the economic sentiment index compiled by the EU’s executive commission indicate consumer are fretting over prices. It’s unclear if they expect higher prices in the future, possibly due to the threat of tariffs from the new Trump administration, or if they are responding to recent price increases."

        "content": "BERLIN (AP) — The German government on Wednesday slashed its 2025 growth forecast for the country’s economy, Europe’s biggest, to just 0.3% after it shrank for two consecutive years. The new projection is much lower than the government’s previous forecast of 1.1% growth, issued in October. Germany has managed no meaningful economic growth in the past four years as it has struggled to deal with major shifts in the global economy and with structural challenges of its own. Preliminary figures released two weeks ago showed that gross domestic product contracted by 0.2% last year, following a 0.3% decline in 2023. The economy is one of the top issues in the campaign for an early German parliamentary election on Feb. 23. It is being held seven months before it was originally scheduled after Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s three-party coalition collapsed in November in a dispute about how to revitalize the economy. Contenders to lead the next government have made contrasting proposals on how to get it growing again. Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck, who is also Germany’s economy minister, said in a statement that “the global crises of recent years have hit our industry- and export-oriented economy particularly hard,” although an energy crunch was headed off after Russia’s full-scale invasion and inflation has fallen. He said it has become increasingly clear that Germany suffers from fundamental structural problems including a shortage of skilled labor, “overflowing bureaucracy and investment weakness, in private as well as public investment.”  Habeck pointed to “the currently high uncertainty” about U.S. economic and trade policy and uncertainty about Germany’s own post-election course as a brake on sentiment for investment and consumers. Germany’s main industry lobby group on Tuesday issued an even gloomier outlook for this year. It forecast that the economy will shrink again, contracting by 0.1%. “For years, governments have delayed important reforms, held back investments and made do with the status quo,” said Peter Leibinger, the head of the Federation of German Industries, or BDI."

        "headline": "5 economic forces that could shape the first year of Trump’s presidency",
        "date": "January 24, 2025",
        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Like most presidents, Donald Trump faces an economy that seldom bends to political ambitions. The Republican has promised strong growth, high tariffs, income tax cuts and booming oilfields. But despite the solid job market and low 4.1% unemployment rate, he has to contend with headwinds like inflation, a budget deficit, increased tensions over trade, the fallout from his plans to curtail immigration and a persistent wealth gap. Each of these issues could help to shape how voters feel about a president they returned to the White House with the specific goal of fixing the economy. For his part, Trump wants to blame all the challenges before him on his predecessor, Joe Biden, who in turn blamed Trump in 2021 for the problems his own administration had to tackle. “This begins with confronting the economic chaos caused by the failed policies of the last administration,” Trump told the World Economic Forum on Thursday. Here are five economic forces that could shape the first year of Trump’s presidency: Whipping inflation is easier said than done. In AP VoteCast, an extensive survey of last year’s electorate, 4 in 10 voters called inflation the “single most important factor” in their choice for president. About two-thirds of this group voted for Trump — a sign he owes his victory in large part to the high cost of groceries, gasoline, housing, autos and other goods. Going forward, monthly reports on the consumer price index will be a clear measure of whether Trump can deliver. But inflation has actually increased in recent months. Consumer prices were increasing at a healthy 2.4% annual rate in September, compared with 2.9% in December. Economists say inflation could worsen if Trump imposes tariffs and uses deficit-funded income tax cuts.  Republicans often hit Biden hard on egg prices. But Democrats could use similar attacks on Trump. Over the past year, coffee costs have risen just 1% for U.S. consumers, but the International Monetary Fund has the price of the actual beans climbing 55% in a sign that lattes, espressos and plain old cups of joe could soon cost more. Then there’s housing. Voters are still frustrated by high mortgage rates and prices staying elevated due to a shortage of properties. Shelter is 37% of the consumer price index. Price increases for housing have eased, but shelter costs are still rising at 4.6% a year, compared with annual increases averaging 3.3% before the pandemic. Trump is betting that more energy production can cut into inflation rates, but domestic production is already near record levels, according to the government. Trump says 25% tariffs are coming for Mexican and Canadian imports as soon as Feb. 1. He’s also talked about additional tariffs of 10% on Chinese goods. His stated goal is to stop illegal border crossings and the flow of chemicals used to make drugs such as fentanyl. For Trump, tariffs are a diplomatic tool for his policy goals. But they’re also a threat possibly meant to jumpstart trade talks. They’re also a revenue raiser that he claims could bring trillions of dollars into the treasury. Trump did increase tariffs during his first term, with revenue collection more than doubling to an annual rate of $85.4 billion, which might sound like a lot but was equal to just 0.4% of the gross domestic product. Multiple analyses by the Budget Lab at Yale and the Peterson Institute for International Economics , among others, say the threatened tariffs would increase costs for a typical family in a way that effectively raises taxes. What really matters is whether Trump delivers on his threats. That is why Ben Harris, a former Biden adviser who is now director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, says voters should focus on average tariff rates. “Trade is really tricky” Harris said. “But in broad terms, look at what he does and not what he says.” Trump likes to blame inflation on the national debt, saying Biden’s policies flooded the U.S. economy with more money than it could absorb. But about 22% of the $36 trillion outstanding total debt originated from the policies of Trump’s first term, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog. Paul Winfree, a former Trump staffer who is now president and CEO of the Economic Policy Innovation Center, warned in a recent analysis that the U.S. is getting too close for comfort to its fiscal limits. His analysis suggests that if Trump can preserve 3% growth he could extend his expiring 2017 tax cuts while keeping the debt sufficiently stable by cutting spending $100 billion to $140 billion a year. The risk is that higher borrowing costs and debt can limit what Trump does while keeping borrowing costs high for consumers. Lawmakers who once viewed the debt as problem years away increasingly see it as something to address now. “One of the biggest vibe shifts I’m picking up on now among policymakers is they’re beginning to realize the long-term is today,” Winfree said. Winfree said the key number to watch is the interest rates charged on U.S. debt — which will tell the public if investors think the amount of borrowing is problematic. Interest on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note is at roughly 4.6%, up a full percentage point since September. Trump’s executive orders are a clear crackdown on immigration — and that could be a drag on economic growth and cause monthly job gains to slow. Trump often frames immigration as a criminal and national security issue by focusing on people crossing the border illegally. But economies that can’t add enough workers are at risk of stagnating — and the U.S. labor market at this stage needs immigrants as part of the jobs mix. About 84% of America’s net population growth last year came from immigrants, according to the Census Bureau . That’s 2.8 million immigrants. “They not only work in the economy, but they spend in the economy,” said Satyam Panday, chief U.S. economist at S&P Global Ratings. “Their spending is somebody else’s income in the economy.” If Trump were simply to put immigration back at his 2017 and 2019 averages of 750,000 immigrants annually, growth could slow from an estimated 2.7% last year to 2% going forward, Panday’s analysis found. The construction, agriculture and leisure and hospitality industries would probably struggle to find employees. In other words, it’s worth monitoring the monthly jobs report and immigration flows. Trump is going to have to figure out how to balance the interests of billionaires with those of his blue- collar voters. His inaugural events included several of the world’s wealthiest men: Tesla’s Elon Musk, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg and LVMH’s Bernard Arnault. Each is worth roughly $200 billion or more, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire’s Index. Scott Ellis, a member of the group Patriotic Millionaires, said it’s worth monitoring just how much their wealth increases under Trump. This year, as of Friday, Arnault’s net worth has risen $23 billion, Bezos is up by $15 billion, Zuckerberg is up by $18 billion and Musk’s wealth has risen by $6 billion. Those are all monthly increases. By contrast, the most recent available Census Bureau data show that the median U.S. household wealth rose $9,600 in 2021-2022, to $176,500."

        "date": "January 23, 2025",
        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has pledged cheaper prices and lower interest rates, but an economy transformed by the pandemic will make those promises difficult to keep. Economic growth is solid , driven by healthy consumer spending . And budget deficits are huge and could get even larger. Meanwhile, businesses are borrowing more to step up their investments in data centers and artificial intelligence, leading to a greater demand for loans that can raise interest rates. And if Trump follows through on his promises to impose widespread tariffs on imports and deport millions of immigrants, economists expect inflation could worsen -- making it less likely the Federal Reserve will cut its key interest rate much this year. All of these trends will likely keep borrowing costs higher, including for homes and cars. Yet on Thursday during the World Economic Forum’s annual event in Davos , Switzerland, Trump said he would reduce oil prices, and then “I’ll demand that interest rates drop immediately, and likewise, they should be dropping all over the world.” Later, in Washington, Trump told reporters that lower energy costs would reduce inflation, which would “automatically bring the interest rates down.” Asked if he expects the Fed to listen to him on rates, Trump said: “Yeah.” Yet Trump may be facing a bigger challenge than he expects. The surprising resilience of the economy — which has weathered the aftermath of the pandemic, an inflation spike, and several recession scares just in the past few years — may keep borrowing costs higher.  Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, says the economy is “in the sweet spot of healthy growth.” It has expanded at an annual rate of at least 3% for four out of the last five quarters, the longest such streak in a decade. Unemployment is at a historically low 4.1% . And inflation, which soared to a four-decade high in 2022 and soured most Americans on the economy, is back down to 2.4% , according to the Fed’s preferred measure. Wages, which badly trailed prices in 2021 and 2022, have risen faster than inflation for the past 18 months, which provides the needed fuel for ongoing growth. A healthier economy spurs more Americans to borrow to buy cars, homes, and large appliances, and businesses to invest in IT equipment and factories. Such moves are great for the economy — but more demand for loans to fund all that spending can also keep interest rates elevated. And steadier growth could keep prices higher. Companies that see healthy consumer demand may decide they can charge more, as Netflix announced it would do Tuesday after signing up a surge of subscribers. Such trends are a big change from the last time Trump entered the White House in 2017. Back then, the U.S. economy was emerging from an extended period of sluggish growth and very low inflation that followed the painful 2008-2009 Great Recession. Millions of households saved more and spent less after a borrowing binge earlier in the decade that drove up mortgage and credit card debt. “Households were shrinking their balance sheets relative to their income, and that’s a very significant disinflationary force that is not present now,” said Julia Coronado, president of MacroPolicy Perspectives and a former Fed economist. Today, most households are carrying less debt and upper-income families in particular are benefitting from strong gains in home values and stock market wealth. About 40% of homes are now owned free and clear — without a mortgage. Greater wealth can spur ongoing spending on travel, electronics, and dining out. In addition, high-tech firms are ramping up their investment in data centers to accelerate their work on artificial intelligence. Trump announced Tuesday a joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle and Japan’s Softbank to invest $500 billion in data centers and electricity generation to fuel AI research. Before the pandemic, many companies were stockpiling cash and weren’t investing as much, which can keep interest rates lower. “We are in a different world,” said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, a tax advisory and consulting firm. “Gone is the era of low inflation and low interest rates. In its place is a new framework featuring scarce capital and higher rates.” As a result, Trump’s promises to stimulate the economy through tax cuts and deregulation, while also promising to impose tariffs and immigration restrictions, could keep prices elevated. “That’s going to be inflationary, and that’s going to push (Fed) policymakers to adopt more stringent policies than they would otherwise,” said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY. “So you’re going to be in a higher interest-rate environment.” Even if the Fed does reduce its key rate in the coming months, that won’t necessarily reduce borrowing costs. Financial markets also affect the cost of borrowing for a home or car. Since the Fed began cutting its key rate in September, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note — which strongly influences mortgage rates — has actually risen substantially . Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities, says investors are anticipating a continuation of stronger growth, in part fueled by Trump’s proposals to cut taxes and reduce regulation. In that scenario, the Fed would be less likely to cut its key rate. Many investors are discounting Trump’s tariff threats, hoping that he intends to use them as leverage in international talks, rather than permanently impose them. “I think there was an expectation that President Trump would bring all of the good policies and leave all of the bad policies for growth at the door,” Goldberg said. Another trend that Trump has helped spark is the rise of protectionist measures around the world, after two decades of globalization that lowered the prices for manufactured goods. “Instead of globalization driving prices lower, or at the very least putting a constraint on them, we’re now relocating supply chains and protectionist barriers are going up,” Brusuelas said. Nearly all economists forecast that will push prices higher, though the increase could be modest. Another shift is that stubbornly high yearly budget deficits threaten to lift interest rates as well, because Wall Street investors may require higher yields to buy all the Treasury securities needed to finance the debt. Last week, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said this year’s deficit would likely reach $1.9 trillion, and grow to $2.7 trillion in a decade. Trump’s proposals to extend his 2017 tax cuts, and implement new ones, such as eliminating taxes on tips, would raise deficits further. “If we don’t get fiscal deficits down, we’re going to see higher longer-term bond yields,” said Fed governor Chris Waller earlier this month. “And that’s what we’re starting to see.”"

        "date": "January 21, 2025",
        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Monday that he expects to put 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico starting on Feb. 1, while declining to flesh out his plans for taxing Chinese imports. Trump made the announcement in response to reporters’ questions while signing executive actions in the Oval Office on his first day back in the White House. Trump threatened tariffs of as much as 60% on China during his campaign, but appeared to temper his plans after a phone call last week with Chinese President Xi Jinping. He said Monday there would be more discussions with his counterpart in the world’s second largest economy. “We’re going to have meetings and calls with President Xi,” Trump said. Trump is placing a big bet that his executive actions can cut energy prices and tame inflation and that the tariffs will strengthen the economy instead of exposing consumers to higher prices. But it’s unclear whether his orders will be enough to foster the growing economy with lower prices that he promised voters. Trump specifically blamed the inflation on the $1.9 trillion in pandemic aid provided in 2021 by then-President Joe Biden, while saying that his predecessor’s policies restricted oil drilling despite domestic output being near record levels. “The inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending,” Trump said in his inaugural address. Orders on Monday included opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil drilling and easing the regulatory burdens on oil and natural gas production. He also declared a national energy emergency in hopes of jumpstarting more electricity production in the competition with China to build out technologies such as artificial intelligence that rely on data centers using massive amounts of energy.  Trump also signed a directive telling federal agencies to conduct a 30-day review of how they can help to lower the costs of housing, health care, food, energy and home appliances as well as finding ways to bring more people into the workforce. Another measure he signed will keep the social media platform TikTok open for 75 days so it can find a U.S. buyer, instead of shutting it down. Trump also signed a measure telling federal agencies to study trade policies and have the Treasury and Commerce departments advise on how to create an “External Revenue Service” for collecting customs and duties tied to trade. The measure set a series of April deadlines. Still, Trump wanted to make clear on Monday in his speeches that he was eager to impose taxes on imports. Trump pledged in his inaugural address that tariffs would be coming and said foreign countries would be paying the trade penalties, even though those taxes are currently paid by domestic importers and often passed along to consumers. Trump later on Monday said tariffs would “make us rich as hell.” A top official with the Canadian government said it would be prepared for almost all possibilities regarding the status of trade with the United States. “Perhaps he’s made decisions to sort of suspend the threat of tariffs over a whole slate of countries. We will wait and see,” Canadian Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc said. “Mr. Trump has been in a previous mandate unpredictable, so our job is to make sure we are ready for any scenario.” Overall, the Republican faces an array of challenges with fulfilling his ambitions to lower prices. Biden managed to see the inflation rate drop over two years yet he was leaving office with price growth still outpacing wages over the past four years. A big driver of inflation is a persistent housing shortage, and U.S. oil production is already at record levels, with producers facing uncertainty about global demand this year. The Federal Reserve is technically the government body tasked with keeping inflation at a roughly 2% annual target. Its usual levers are setting short-term rates for banks lending to each other, in addition to bond purchases and public communications. Trump has said natural resource production is key to lowering costs for American consumers, both at the pump and in their utility bills. Energy prices permeate every part of the economy, so increasing U.S. production of oil, natural gas and other fossil fuels is critical to national security. Trump, who has pledged to restore U.S. “energy dominance,” has complained that the Biden administration limited Alaska’s oil and gas production. Trump showed his relative indifference to the fossil fuels accelerating climate change, even as he lamented natural disasters such as the Los Angeles wildfires. He said he would again withdraw the United States from the landmark Paris climate agreement, dealing a blow to efforts to combat global warming and once again distancing the U.S. from its closest allies. Energy can impact prices, but it’s not the largest chunk of families’ spending. According to the weightings for the consumer price index, energy spending represents on average just 6% of expenditures, much less than food (13%) or shelter (37%). Inflation, dormant for decades, resurfaced in early 2021 as the economy recovered with unexpected strength from COVID-19 lockdowns. A surge in customer orders overwhelmed America’s supply chains, causing delays, shortages and higher prices. Factories for computer chips, furniture and other products worldwide struggled to rebound. Republican lawmakers were quick to blame the Biden administration’s $1.9 trillion pandemic relief, though inflation was a global phenomenon that points to factors beyond U.S. policy. Inflation further worsened after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, pushing up energy and food prices. In response, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023. Inflation has come down from a four-decade high 9.1% in mid-2022. But inflation has picked up since September to an annual rate of 2.9% in December. Voters were unimpressed with the progress against inflation, frustrated that prices remained more than 20% higher than they were four years ago while average weekly earnings had not kept up. Higher grocery prices – up 27% from February 2021 -- were especially painful. After the inaugural address, Trump played down the importance of inflation in the 2024 election, suggesting in remarks at the Capitol that his voters cared more about immigration because there were only so many ways to talk about prices. “How many times can you say that an apple has doubled in cost?” Trump said. Associated Press writer Rob Gillies in Toronto contributed to this report."

The Washington-based lending agency expects the world economy to grow 3.3% this year and next, up from 3.2% in 2024. The growth is steady but unimpressive: From 2000 to 2019, the world economy grew faster – an average of 3.7% a year.

The IMF is a 191-nation lending organization that works to promote economic growth and financial stability and to reduce global poverty. Global inflation, which had surged after the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted global supply chains and caused shortages and higher prices, is forecast to fall from 5.7% in 2024 to 4.2% this year and 3.5% in 2026. But in a blog post that accompanied the release of the IMF’s latest World Economic Outlook report, the fund’s chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, wrote that the policies Trump has promised to introduce “are likely to push inflation higher in the near term.’’ Big tax cuts could overheat the U.S. economy and inflation. Likewise, hefty tariffs on foreign products could at least temporarily push up prices and hurt exporting countries around the world. And mass deportations could cause restaurants, construction companies and other businesses to run short of workers, pushing up their costs and weighing on economic growth.  Gourinchas also wrote that Trump’s plans to slash regulations on business could “boost potential growth in the medium term if they remove red tape and stimulate innovation.’’ But he warned that “excessive deregulation could also weaken financial safeguards and increase financial vulnerabilities, putting the U.S. economy on a dangerous boom-bust path.’’ Trump inherits a strong U.S. economy . The IMF expects U.S. growth to come in at 2.7% this year, a hefty half percentage point upgrade from the 2.2% it had forecast in October. The American economy — the world’s biggest — is proving resilient in the face of high interest rates, engineered by the Federal Reserve to fight inflation. The U.S. is benefiting from a strong job market that gives consumers the confidence and financial wherewithal to keep spending , from strong gains in productivity and from an influx of immigrants that has eased labor shortages. The U.S. economy’s unexpectedly strong performance stands in sharp contrast to the advanced economies across the Atlantic Ocean. The IMF expects the 20 countries that share the euro currency to collectively grow just 1% this year, up from 0.8% in 2024 but down from the 1.2% it was expecting in October. “Headwinds,” Gourinchas wrote, “include weak momentum, especially in manufacturing, low consumer confidence, and the persistence of a negative energy price shock’’ caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The Chinese economy, No. 2 in the world, is forecast to decelerate – from 4.8% last year to 4.6% in 2025 and 4.5% in 2026. A collapse in the Chinese housing market has undermined consumer confidence. If government doesn’t do enough to stimulate the economy with lower interest rates, stepped-up spending or tax cuts, China “is at risk of a debt-deflation stagnation trap,’’ Gourinchas warned, in which falling prices discourage consumers from spending (because they have an incentive to wait to get still better bargains) and make it more expensive for borrowers to repay loans. The IMF forecasts came out a day after its sister agency, the World Bank, predicted global growth of 2.7% in 2025 and 2026, same as last year and 2023. The bank, which makes loans and grants to poor countries, warned that the growth wasn’t sufficient to reduce poverty in low-income countries. The IMF’s global growth estimates tend to be higher than the World Bank’s because they give more weight to faster-growing developing countries."

The IMF’s global growth estimates tend to be higher than the World Bank’s because they give more weight to faster-growing developing countries."

        "date": "January 17, 2025",
        "content": "HONG KONG (AP) — China’s economy expanded at a 5% annual pace in 2024, slower than the year before but in line with Beijing’s target of “around 5%” growth, thanks to strong exports and recent stimulus measures. The economy picked up speed in the last quarter, the government reported Friday, growing 5.4% in October-December. Exports have surged as companies and consumers rush to beat potential tariff hikes President-elect Donald Trump may impose on Chinese goods. “The national economy was generally stable with steady progress and new achievements were made in high-quality development,” the report by the National Bureau of Statistics said. “Particularly, with a package of incremental policies being timely rolled out, public confidence was effectively bolstered and the economy recovered remarkably,” it said. Manufacturing was a strong engine for growth last year, with industrial output jumping 5.8% from a year earlier. Total retail sales of consumer goods grew 3.5% at an annual rate. Exports expanded 7.1% in annual terms, while imports grew 2.3%. The world’s second largest economy has struggled with weaker consumer spending and resulting deflationary pressures as its recovery after the COVID 19 pandemic faltered and the property sector, once a main driver of business activity, fell into a downturn. The Chinese economy grew at a 5.2% annual rate in 2023, and economists have forecast that it will slow further in coming years.   Zichun Huang of Capital Economics said that the economy regained some momentum last quarter thanks to recent policy easing. “Increased fiscal spending should continue to provide a near-term prop to activity,” Huang said in a report. “We still expect growth to slow for 2025 as a whole, with Trump likely to follow through on his tariff threats soon and persistent structural imbalances still weighing on the economy.” China’s population also is aging and declining, adding to pressures on growth. The government reported Friday that the population fell for a third straight year in 2024, to 1.408 billion at the end of 2024, a decline of 1.39 million from the previous year. With costs of living rising faster than wages, young Chinese are putting off or ruling out marriage and childbirth, accentuating the impact of birth control policies that once limited most families to one child each. Some economists say the economy is growing at a slower pace than shown in official estimates. “The precise achievement of the official growth target is highly dubious at a time when most indicators of economic activity and financial markets are flashing red,” Eswar Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University, said in an emailed comment. “The economy continues to be beset by a combination of weak domestic demand and persistent deflationary pressures, in addition to a hostile external environment that could limit exports,” he said. Trump, who will be inaugurated next week, has pledged to increase U.S. import duties on Chinese goods. This week, the Biden administration also imposed further restrictions on exports of advanced semiconductors and technology, seeking to maintain the U.S. lead on advanced technologies and block China’s access. The ruling Communist Party has rolled out a series of stimulus measures , including reducing banks’ reserve requirement ratios, cutting interest rates and frontloading billions from its budget in 2025 to fund construction projects. It has ordered banks to lend to beleaguered property developers that were left mired in debt after authorities cracked down on excess borrowing. National Bureau of Statistics spokesperson Fu Linghui told reporters in Beijing that boosting consumption and expanding domestic demand are priorities this year. “With the coordinated efforts of stock policies and a package of incremental policies, the momentum of economic recovery is strengthening, the recovery of consumer demand has accelerated, and there are more favorable factors for a moderate rebound in prices,” he said. Beijing has expanded a trade-in scheme for consumer goods and raised the wages of millions of government workers to revive domestic demand. Those incremental moves need to be accompanied by broader structural reforms, some economists say, that will improve productivity and make the economy less reliant on construction and export manufacturing. In particular, private businesses remain wary of boosting investment or hiring after years of policy shifts that have added to uncertainty over their role in the economy. Scant social safety nets, meanwhile, lead families to save rather than spend, and falling housing prices and weak stock prices have hurt household wealth, compounding the problem. “China needs a strong and multi-pronged policy package to revive growth momentum,” Prasad said. Such a package would need to include substantial and well-targeted monetary and fiscal stimulus, complemented by reforms and other measures to revive private sector confidence.”"

        "headline": "World Bank says the global is economy is growing steadily, but not fast enough to help ease poverty",
        "date": "January 16, 2025",
        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The global economy is growing steadily in the face of war, protectionist trade policies and high interest rates. It just isn’t growing fast enough to bring relief to the world’s poorest, the World Bank said Thursday in its latest assessment of the global economy. The bank expects the world economy to expand 2.7% in 2025 and again in 2026. It’s a remarkably consistent performance – matching 2023 and 2024 – but also a lackluster one. Growth is running 0.4 percentage points below the 2010-2019 average. The slump reflects lingering damage from the “adverse shocks of recent years,’’ including COVID-19 and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The bank’s latest Global Economics Prospects report, which comes out in January and June, did offer some good news. Global inflation, which was running over 8% two years ago, is expected to slow to an average of 2.7% in 2025 and 2026, close to many central bank targets. The World Bank, comprising 189 member nations, seeks to reduce poverty and boost living standards by providing grants and low-rate loans to poor economies. For low- and middle-income countries – so-called developing economies – growth is expected to come in at 4.1% this year and slow slightly to 4% in 2026. The World Bank says that plodding pace of growth is “insufficient’’ to ease global poverty. The World Bank noted that growth has been decelerating for years in the developing world – from a robust average of 5.9% a year in the 2000s to 5.1% in the 2010s to just 3.5% in the 2020s. Excluding China and India, those countries are lagging behind the world’s wealthy countries in per-capita economic growth.  Their economies have been hobbled by sluggish investment, high levels of debt, the increasing costs of climate change and growing protectionism that hurts their exports. None of those things seems likely to go away anytime soon. “The next 25 years will be a tougher slog for developing economies than the last 25,’’ World Bank chief economist Indermit Gill said in the report. The world’s poorest countries – with per-person annual incomes below $1,145 – grew just 3.6% in 2024 “on account of escalating conflict and violence’’ in places like Gaza and Sudan. “We have all-out war in Europe, in the Middle East and in Africa,’’ Gill told reporters ahead of the report’s release. “Conflicts are the worst economy killers.’’ The bank expects low-income countries’ growth to rebound to 5.7% this year and 5.9% in 2026, “contingent’’ on the easing of conflict in some places. The World Bank marked up the outlook for the United States, the world’s largest economy. It now expects U.S. gross domestic product – the nation’s output of goods and services – to expand 2.3% this year. That is down from 2.8% in 2024 but up from the 1.8% the bank forecast for this year back in June. The American economy has managed to thrive despite high interest rates. U.S. growth has been boosted by strong consumer spending, an influx of immigrants who eased labor shortages and improvements in productivity. Europe, by contrast, is expanding at an agonizingly slow pace. The World Bank downgraded its GDP growth forecast for the 20 countries that share the euro currency to 1% this year from the 1.4% it had projected in June. The bank cited “anemic’’ consumer spending, business investment and manufacturing activity, partly reflecting the cost of high energy prices. The Chinese economy, the world’s second biggest, is expected to decelerate – from 4.9% growth last year to 4.5% in 2025 and 4% in 2026. China’s real estate market has crashed, demoralizing consumers and causing them to rein in their spending. But Chinese exports and investment in factories and infrastructure have been sturdy. Meanwhile, India, which has supplanted China as the world’s fastest-growing major economy, is expected to see a 6.7% expansion both this year and next. In rural areas, a recovery in farm production has boosted consumer spending – though inflation and slow lending growth have discouraged shoppers in cities. The World Bank’s forecasts assume no major shifts in trade or budget policies. But in the United States, President-elect Donald Trump is promising big things – slashing taxes, slapping hefty tariffs on foreign goods, deporting millions of immigrants who are working in the country illegally. All those policies could drive up U.S. inflation and disrupt global trade. The bank said that the outlook for U.S. economic policy is “unclear, with resulting impacts on U.S. and global growth and inflation clouded by uncertainty.’’"

        "headline": "Why are interest rates rising when the Fed has been cutting them?",
        "date": "January 16, 2025",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — What’s shaking Wall Street seems so backwards. Swings in the bond market recently sent the yield on the 10-year Treasury above 4.80% and its highest level since 2023. That’s injected nervousness into the U.S. stock market and knocked indexes off their records. The bond market’s moves might seem strange given that the Federal Reserve has lowered interest rates three times starting in September. But it’s a reminder that markets care more about the future than the present. And the bond market is worried about potentially higher inflation ahead, along with a U.S. economy that may not need more help from easier interest rates. That’s hurting stock prices.  The Fed has cut its main interest rate by a full percentage point since September. The intent is to give the economy breathing room after the Fed earlier hiked the federal funds rate to a two-decade high in hopes of slowing the economy enough to stifle inflation. But the Fed’s influence is limited when it comes to the interest rates that are currently knocking the stock market around, chiefly the 10-year Treasury yield. The Fed controls the federal funds rate, which is a very short-term interest rate that dictates what banks charge each other for borrowing money overnight. The moves for the 10-year Treasury yield, meanwhile, are set by investors. Those investors do take the Fed’s moves into account as they decide how much yield they’ll need to earn from U.S. Treasurys before they’ll lend money to the federal government. But they’re also factoring in where the economy and inflation are heading.  And the 10-year Treasury yield ironically began rising in September, up from 3.65%, just about when the federal funds rate began sinking for the first time since 2020. The 10-year yield rose, even as the Fed was cutting overnight interest rates, because expectations for both economic growth and for inflation were rising. Much of that is due to a string of reports showing the U.S. economy remains much more solid than expected. Inflation was also more stubborn to ease, though this past week’s reading offered more optimism and helped Treasury yields give back some of their big gains. In late 2018, something similar happened in the market, but in the opposite direction. The Fed had been increasing the federal funds rate since early 2017, and the 10-year Treasury yield likewise climbed for much of that stretch. But the 10-year yield began turning lower before the end of 2018. It even continued to sink after the Fed hiked the federal funds rate in December 2018, guessing correctly that rate increases would stop before putting too much pressure on the economy. President-elect Donald Trump is also a big factor. His proposals to place tariffs on imported goods could push up inflation, while his preference for lower tax rates could inflate the U.S. government’s debt further and scare investors into requiring higher interest rates for the added risk. The Federal Reserve itself warned recently that it may cut interest rates only twice in 2025 after earlier projecting four cuts. Traders on Wall Street are questioning whether the Fed may not cut short-term interest rates at all in 2025. Even Wednesday’s better-than-expected reading on an underlying measure of inflation wasn’t enough to give the market an all clear. “We believe It likely will take several months of slowing inflation to get the Fed — and the market — thinking about another rate cut,” said Gary Schlossberg, market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute."

        "headline": "Germany’s economy shrank for the second consecutive year in 2024",
        "date": "January 15, 2025",
        "content": "BERLIN (AP) — Germany’s economy shrank for the second straight year in 2024 as worried consumers held back on spending and Chinese competition ate into the country’s traditional exports of cars and industrial machinery. The year’s weak performance underlines Germany’s status as Europe’s worst performing major economy and shows the country as having no meaningful growth in the past four years as it has struggled to deal with major shifts in the global economy. Gross domestic product contracted by 0.2% last year, following a 0.3% decline in 2023, according to preliminary official figures released Wednesday, weeks before an election in which the economy is the top issue. The economy is now only 0.3% bigger than it was in 2019, the year before the COVID-19 pandemic. German business has been battered by external shocks and homegrown problems, unleashing an angst-ridden national debate over how to remedy the situation. Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s three-party coalition government collapsed in November when Scholz fired his finance minister in a dispute over how to revitalize the economy. That paved the way for an early election on Feb. 23. Contenders to lead the next government have made contrasting proposals on how to inject new vigor into the economy. Ruth Brand, the head of the statistics office, ticked off the list of short- and long-term challenges: higher energy prices after the loss of cheap natural gas from Russia; high interest rates from the European Central Bank that deter investment in new machinery and vehicles; and consumers worried about the future who are saving their wages instead of spending them.  Spending on hotels and restaurants sagged by 4.4% and outlays for clothing and shoes fell by 2.8% despite rising disposable income. On top of that comes increasing competition for export markets from China in traditional areas of German strength such as cars, industrial machinery and chemicals. Other, more chronic issues include excessive bureaucracy and a shortage of skilled labor. “German exports saw themselves exposed to stronger international competition, not least from the People’s Republic of China,” Brand said. “German exports shrank although world trade increased in 2024.” “The German economy is mired in stagnation,” said Nils Jannsen of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. And prospects for growth in the coming year are “gloomy,” he said, with the “sword of Damocles” hanging over the export-oriented economy from possible new U.S. trade measures such as higher tariffs on imported goods from the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Monday. Despite the weak growth figures, the jobs market remains strong and disposable income is rising along with pay raises from new wage agreements aimed at making up for inflation. But a willingness to spend is being held back by worries fed by a range of factors, including a drumbeat of job cut announcements at major companies including Volkswagen, steelmaker and industrial conglomerate Thyssenkrupp and auto technology supplier Bosch, and by the war in Ukraine. Brand said that the economy is believed to have shrunk by 0.1% in the fourth quarter compared with the previous three-month period. That, however, is a rough initial estimate because hard economic data for December haven’t yet been released."

        "headline": "Surging job market could prove costly for households, businesses as odds of quick rate cuts fade",
        "date": "January 11, 2025",
        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. job growth surged and unemployment fell last month, an unexpected show of strength that may prove costly to homebuyers and businesses who were counting on sharply lower interest rates to lower the cost of buying everything from refrigerators to homes. Employers added 256,000 jobs last month, up from 212,000 in November, the Labor Department reported Friday. Unemployment, which was expected to hover around 4.2%, fell to 4.1% last month. Health care companies added 46,000 jobs, retailers 43,000 and government agencies at the federal, state and local levels 33,000. The final jobs report of 2024 underscores that the economy and hiring were able to grow at a solid pace even with interest rates much higher than they were before the pandemic. As a result, the Federal Reserve could be much less likely to cut borrowing costs again in the coming months. The Fed cut its rate three times last year in part out of concern that hiring and growth were flagging. Overall, the solid jobs figures suggest the economy is entering a post-COVID period of steady growth, higher interest rates, low unemployment, and slightly elevated inflation. “There’s just no need for additional cuts in the Fed’s rate any time soon,” said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, an accounting and tax advisory firm. Brusuelas says that the economy, fueled in part by greater productivity, can grow at a steadily faster rate than it has since the Great Recession 16 years ago. Low unemployment can fuel healthy consumer spending. Yet greater demand can also push up inflation.  “The economy is going to grow at a much higher equilibrium level, which implies higher inflation and higher interest rates relative to what we got used to from 2000 to 2020,” he said. The U.S. continued to create jobs steadily throughout 2024, 2.2 million in all. That is down from job growth of 3 million in 2023, 4.5 million in 2022 and a record 6.4 million in 2021 as the economy bounced back from massive COVID-19 layoffs. But last year’s average of 186,000 new jobs a month still slightly exceeds the pre-pandemic average of 182,000 from 2016-2019, solid years for the economy. U.S. markets tumbled on the release of December’s jobs numbers as investors sensed the odds of further interest rate cuts have faded. But rates are still painfully high for Americans trying to buy a house, a car, or even a kitchen appliance. Mortgage rates have risen for four consecutive weeks to reach the highest level since July. Average hourly wages rose 0.3% from November and 3.9% from a year earlier. The year-over-year wage gain was slightly less than economists had forecast. Over the past few years, the strength of the U.S. economy and the job market have surprised almost everyone. Responding to inflation that hit a four-decade high two and a half years ago, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate – the fed funds rate -- 11 times in 2022 and 2023, pushing it to the highest level in more than two decades. A much-anticipated recession never happened. Companies kept hiring, consumers kept spending, and the economy continued to roll. In fact, U.S. gross domestic product – the nation’s output of goods and services -- has expanded at a robust annual pace of 3% or more in four of the last five quarters. Inflation has come down, too, from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022 to 2.7% in November. The drop in year-over-year price increases gave the Fed enough confidence to cut rates three times in the last four months of 2024. But Fed officials signaled in December that they planned to be more cautious about rate cuts this year. They now project just two rate reductions in 2025, down from the four they envisioned back in September. Progress against inflation has stalled in recent months, and it remains stuck above the Fed’s 2% target. “There is more to do to lower costs, but we’ve taken action to lower prescription drug prices, health insurance premiums, utility bills, and gas prices that will pay dividends for years to come,” President Joe Biden said Friday. “This has been a hard-fought recovery, but we’ve made progress for working families, showing what can be accomplished when we build from the middle out and bottom up.” Biden is handing a largely solid economy to his successor, President-elect Donald Trump, though many Americans have been hit hard by the price spikes of the past three years and have generally been pessimistic about the economic outlook. Many businesses are still scrambling to find workers. Optimistic about 2025, Matt Harding, chief concept officer at Piada Italian Street Food, plans to open seven new stores and hire another 250 people this year. The fast casual restaurant chain, based in Columbus, Ohio, now operates 58 stores in seven states and has 1,200 employees. Hourly pay has risen 35% to 40% since 2020 to a starting wage as high as $16.45 for typical workers, helping to reducer turnover. UCHealth, a nonprofit that runs hospitals and clinics in Colorado, Wyoming and Nebraska, is struggling to find skilled clinical workers – nurses, physical and occupational therapists, said Angela Spinelli, UCHealth’s senior director of talent acquisition. “The market has not softened for these positions,’’ Spinelli said. UCHealth, which hired 9,400 people last year and currently has 1,200 openings, has raised pay and focused on “growing our own’’ – promoting within the company and offering tuition to employees to learn new skills to move from, say, a health aid to a nursing position. Still, a job hunt can still be tough in the current environment. Mike Pincus was out of work for 20 months after the startup where he’d worked went out of business. Pincus, 55, had previously spent 35 years as a personal trainer and wanted to try something new. “I didn’t know exactly what I wanted to do,’’ he said. “But I knew what I didn’t want to do.’’ The search proved frustrating. Pincus said that many employers seemed to use algorithms to weed out unconventional applicants. “If a human actually looks at your resume, it’s a very quick glance over,’’ he said. Visiting a friend at a bike shop, his “happy place,” Pincus applied and received a job there. He’s been a manager at Trek’s Ventura, California, shop since early December. “I love it,’’ he said. “I didn’t know I’d love it. I didn’t know I could do it.’’ AP Writers Christopher Rugaber and Josh Boak in Washington and Anne D’Innocenzio in New York contributed to this story."

        "date": "January 08, 2025",
        "content": "BANGKOK (AP) — China’s leaders are bracing for shocks to the economy from higher tariffs threatened by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump once he takes office. To help rev up an economy bogged down by a property crisis and disruptions during the pandemic, the ruling Communist Party is rolling out a slew of measures to get Chinese consumers and businesses to spend more money and counter a slump in the Chinese currency and stock prices. Here are some of the top items on China’s list of priorities for 2025: China plans to expand its cash for clunkers and appliance recycling programs to encourage more purchases of new, energy-efficient models. The recycling that began last year has led to the replacement of 6.5 million fuel-powered vehicles with electrics and hybrids since June, officials of China’s main planning agency said Wednesday. They also cited a double-digit growth in the past several months in sales of new appliances. Subsidies of up to 20% of sales prices will now apply to a dozen types of appliances and also include digital products such as mobile phones, they said. The government is also subsidizing the upgrading of outdated factory equipment.  Local officials have been warned not to conduct unjustified “arbitrary inspections” that interfere with normal business, Hu Weilie, a vice minister of Justice, told reporters Tuesday according to state media reports. The official Xinhua News Agency said new rules are meant to prevent abuse of power, arbitrary seizures of assets and unjustified orders to halt production. The effort is part of a campaign aimed at improving China’s business environment, according to Premier Li Qiang. The moves follow complaints that dozens of executives have been detained or assets seized by cash-strapped local governments trying to shake down companies. So far, China has not unleashed a big bazooka of stimulus spending, choosing a more targeted and incremental approach. However, Zhao Chenxin, head of the National Development and Reform Commission, China’s main planning agency, said the government plans to announce “significantly larger” scale long-term treasury bonds to finance such spending. But specific figures won’t come until the annual meeting of the national rubber-stamp legislature, due to be held in early March. China’s central bank said it resolved at a meeting over the weekend to keep the value of the yuan steady and stabilize financial markets. The Chinese currency, also called the renminbi, or “people’s money,” has weakened against the U.S. dollar and other currencies, putting pressure on its financial markets. Its stock market has languished again after a brief revival in late September, when the Shanghai Composite index jumped to nearly 3,700, falling back to just over 3,200. The yuan was trading at 7.3278 to the dollar on Wednesday. It was trading near 7 yuan to the dollar in early October. A weaker yuan can make Chinese exports more competitive but also risks angering Chinese trade partners. China’s ruling party allows very little leeway for public dissent, and even the scope for talking about the economy has narrowed. Authorities have shut down the social media sites of economists challenging policies as they try to rally support for President Xi Jinping’s leadership. A recent report by Xinhua called for ensuring “correct public opinions” that are aligned with creating “a mainstream public opinion of unity and progress.” But talking up the economy can obscure hard realities, said a recent report by the think tank Rhodium Group, which estimated China’s actual economic growth last year at 2.4% to 2.8%, well below the official estimate of about 5%. One big factor behind the lower-than-hoped-for growth is pocketbook issues that crimp demand, such as falling housing prices and smaller paychecks. The report also said: “No substantial policy measures have been announced that will substantially change the employment or wage outlook.”"

        "date": "January 08, 2025",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street held firmer on Wednesday, a day after strong reports on the economy hurt U.S. stocks by stirring up worries that inflation and interest rates may remain higher than expected. The S&P 500 rose 0.2% to recover a bit of its 1.1% slump from the day before. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 106 points, or 0.3%, and the Nasdaq composite edged down by 0.1%. In the bond market, which has been the bigger focus for Wall Street recently, the moves were also more modest following the last month’s charge higher for yields. Higher yields hurt stocks by making it more expensive for companies and households to borrow and by pulling some investors toward bonds and away from stocks. The increased calm returned to the market after reports on the economy Wednesday weren’t as strong as Tuesday’s. That can counterintuitively help Wall Street because it raises hopes that the Federal Reserve may keep cutting short-term interest rates. Wall Street loves lower rates, which can goose the economy and boost prices for investments. Inflation fears have stocks lower. More from AP’s Seth Sutel. Fed Governor Christopher Waller said in a speech Wednesday he still expects the central bank to deliver more easing of rates in 2025, pushing back against nascent speculation it may already be done after cutting three times since September. Waller said he doesn’t expect tariffs that are possibly coming under President-elect Donald Trump to have a “significant or persistent effect” on inflation. And even though inflation has shown stubbornness recently , he still sees it trending downward over the long term.  “If the outlook evolves as I have described here, I will support continuing to cut our policy rate in 2025,” he said. “The pace of those cuts will depend on how much progress we make on inflation, while keeping the labor market from weakening.” The yield on the two-year Treasury, which tends to closely track expectations for Fed action, fell immediately after Waller’s speech and the release of a couple economic reports. It eased to 4.27% from 4.29% late Tuesday. One of the reports suggested U.S. employers outside of the government slowed their hiring in December by more than economists expected. That could offer a hint of what Friday’s more comprehensive jobs report from the Labor Department will show. That update will likely be the main event for Wall Street this week, particularly after the stock market’s closure on Thursday in observance of a National Day of Mourning for former President Jimmy Carter . The hope is that the jobs report will show enough strength to keep worries of a recession stifled but not so much that it keeps the Fed from cutting rates. A separate report on Wednesday, meanwhile, said fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than economists expected. It’s the latest signal that the job market remains remarkably solid . The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which is the centerpiece of the bond market, eased to 4.67% from 4.69% late Tuesday. But it topped 4.70% earlier in the morning and is well above the 4.15% level it was at roughly a month ago. It was below 3.65% in September. Such increases in yields make it more expensive for companies to borrow, and smaller companies can feel particular pain because of the need for many to borrow to grow. The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks fell 0.5%. Also on the losing end of Wall Street was Edison International, which tumbled 10.2% as massive wildfires burn in the Los Angeles area. The company’s Southern California Edison utility said Wednesday it shut off power to nearly 120,000 customers in six counties over safety concerns due to high winds and the risk of wildfires. On the winning end of Wall Street, eBay jumped 9.9% for the biggest gain in the S&P 500. It’s beginning a collaboration with Meta Platforms where a pilot of select eBay listings will appear on Facebook Marketplace in the United States, Germany, and France. Cal-Maine Foods climbed 1% after the egg producer reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Sherman Miller said it sold more dozens of eggs thanks in part to strong demand from the seasonal boost it gets leading into Thanksgiving. Egg prices climbed late last year as a lingering outbreak of bird flu coincided with the high demand of the holiday baking season. Delta Air Lines will report its first-quarter results on Friday, with big banks beginning next week to kick off the latest earnings reporting season in earnest. All told, the S&P 500 rose 9.22 points to 5,918.25. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 106.84 to 42,635.20, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 10.80 to 19,478.88. In stock markets abroad, indexes weakened were mixed across Europe and Asia. South Korea’s Kospi climbed 1.2%, but Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 0.9%. AP Writers Matt Ott and Zimo Zhong contributed."

        "headline": "Stock market today: Wall Street slumps as good news for the economy is once again bad for stocks",
        "date": "January 07, 2025",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Good news on the U.S. economy is back to being bad for Wall Street, and the stock market slumped Tuesday following better-than-expected reports on the job market and business activity. The S&P 500 fell 1.1% after giving up an early gain. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 178 points, or 0.4%, while the Nasdaq composite tumbled 1.9%. Stocks dropped under the weight of rising yields in the bond market, which jumped immediately after the release of the encouraging reports on the economy. One said U.S. employers were advertising more job openings at the end of November than economists expected. The other said activity for finance, retail and other services businesses grew much faster in December than expected. The strong reports are of course good news for workers looking for jobs and for anyone worried about a possible recession that earlier seemed inevitable to pessimists . But such a solid economy could also keep up pressure on inflation, and it could make the Federal Reserve less likely to deliver the cuts to interest rates that Wall Street loves. The Fed began cutting its main interest rate in September to give the economy a boost, but it’s hinted a slowdown in easing is coming. The threat of tariffs from President-elect Donald Trump has raised worries about possible upward pressure on inflation , which has stubbornly remained just above the Fed’s 2% target. Tuesday’s report on U.S. services industries from the Institute for Supply Management also contained discouraging trends on inflation, saying price increases accelerated in December.  Expectations for fewer cuts to interest rates in 2025 had already been building for weeks, which sent longer-term Treasury yields upward. So have worries about other possible Trump policies, such as tax cuts, which could swell the U.S. government’s debt and likewise push yields higher. Those higher yields make Treasury bonds more attractive to investors who might otherwise buy stocks, which in turn puts downward pressure on stock prices, and the super-safe bonds are paying notably more. The yield on a 10-year Treasury climbed to 4.69% from 4.63% shortly before the release of Tuesday’s reports and from just 4.15% in early December. High yields can put heavy pressure on stocks seen as the most expensive, which pulls the lens toward Nvidia and other Big Tech stocks that have soared in the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. Nvidia had been on track to set another all-time high in morning trading, after CEO Jensen Huang unveiled a suite of new products and partnerships the night before. He talked up the potential for AI technology in robotics, among other opportunities for big growth. But after Tuesday morning’s economic reports, which hit the market after its first half hour of trading, Nvidia swung to a loss of 6.2% and became the heaviest weight on the S&P 500. Losses for Amazon, Tesla, Apple and Microsoft were the next-strongest forces dragging the index lower. Now that worries from the summer about a potentially slowing U.S. economy have abated and the 10-year Treasury yield is firmly above 4.50%, “we believe the market is shifting into a ‘good news is bad news’ environment again,” according to Bank of America strategists led by Ohsung Kwon. That raises the stakes for Friday’s coming update on the U.S. job market, which economists expect will show a slowdown in overall hiring. They’re looking for growth of 156,500 jobs in December, according to FactSet. A “Goldilocks” reading for the U.S. stock market that would be solid but not too strong for the Fed would likely be in the 125,000 to 175,000 range, along with an unemployment rate of 4.2%, according to Bank of America. Helping to keep Tuesday’s losses for U.S. stock indexes in check was Cintas, which rose 2% after making public its offer to buy its smaller rival, UniFirst, for $275 per share in cash. Cintas said it first made that offer in November but has been unable to get UniFirst’s board to meet. UniFirst had rejected an earlier offer of $255 per share, said Cintas, which provides uniforms, restroom supplies, fire extinguishers and other products to businesses. UniFirst jumped 20.9% to $204.69, below Cintas’ offer price. Elsewhere on Wall Street, Shutterstock and Getty climbed after they announced they were joining to become a $3.7 billion visual content company to provide customers with a broader array of still imagery, video, music, 3D and other media. Getty Images shareholders will own a slight majority of the combined company. Getty shares jumped 24.1%, while Shutterstock climbed 14.8%. All told, the S&P 500 fell 66.35 points to 5,909.03. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 178.20 to 42,528.36, and the Nasdaq composite sank 375.30 to 19,489.68. In stock markets abroad, some notable Chinese companies fell after the U.S. Defense Department added dozens of them to a list of companies it says have ties to China’s military. The announcement caused some of the companies to protest and say they will seek to have the decision reversed. Added to the list were gaming and technology company Tencent, artificial intelligence firm SenseTime and the world’s biggest battery maker CATL . Tencent’s stock that trades in Hong Kong fell 7.3%. That helped pull the Hang Seng index down 1.2%, but indexes were stronger elsewhere in China and across much of Asia and Europe. AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed."

        "date": "December 26, 2024",
        "content": "BANGKOK (AP) — China’s economy grew a bit more in 2023 than earlier thought, but the revision has not affected forecasts for “about 5%” growth in the GDP this year, the government said Thursday. The estimate for total economic activity, or GDP, in 2023 for the world’s second largest economy was increased by about 2.7% to 129.4 trillion yuan ($17.7 trillion), based on an economic census conducted once every five years. Earlier this year, the government said the GDP in 2023 was 126.06 trillion yuan. The exact impact on China’s annual economic growth in 2023 was not given. Officials said further details would be released later. The economy grew at a 5.2% annual pace in 2023, according to the earlier estimate, up from 3% in 2022. The size of the U.S. economy in 2023 was $27.36 trillion. The economic census included years when the COVID-19 pandemic was causing severe disruptions to business activity, travel and ordinary activities in China. The economy is still recovering from those shocks and from a severe downturn in the housing market that followed a crackdown on excessive borrowing by property developers. The government has stepped up measures to counter the slowdown in consumer spending and business investment, pledging again this week to step up spending and issue more bonds to finance support from local governments that are suffering partly due to the property crisis. Such efforts are helping, the World Bank said in a report Thursday. It lifted its estimate for China’s growth this year to 4.9% from its forecast in June of 4.8%.  The World Bank’s update for China’s annual growth next year was raised to 4.5% from an earlier 4.1%, but it still shows growth slowing in coming years. The forecast for 2026 is for the economy to expand at a 4% pace. Weakness in the property sector remains a drag on growth, and people whose houses have lost value will remain reluctant to spend much. That will keep inflation low, the report said, at 0.4% for this year, rising to 1.1% in 2025. It noted that while moves to boost demand by cutting mortgage down payments and interest rates, funding affordable housing projects and subsidizing recycling programs for cars and appliances are supporting demand, such measures won’t do enough to restore growth to higher levels. The risk of higher tariffs on Chinese exports to the U.S. once President-elect Donald Trump takes office and other limits on trade are other potential threats to the economy given China’s growing reliance on exports to help drive growth. The World Bank reiterated its calls for China to improve its social safety net and to help redress widening inequality to help provide a firmer economic footing for the hundreds of millions of its people who are either low income or part of what it calls the “vulnerable middle class,” and are at risk of falling back into poverty."

        "date": "December 23, 2024",
        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump won a return to the White House in part by promising big changes in economic policy — more tax cuts, huge tariffs on imports, mass deportations of immigrants working in the United States illegally. In some ways, his victory marked a repudiation of President Joe Biden’s economic stewardship and a protest against inflation. It came despite low unemployment and steady growth under the Biden administration. What lies ahead for the economy under Trump? Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics spoke recently to The Associated Press. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. A: It is objectively a strong economy. But that doesn’t mean the man in the street agrees. If you look just at the growth numbers, they’ve been strong, and the unemployment rate’s pretty low. But consumer confidence remains muted. Although the inflation rate has come down, the level of prices remains much higher than it used to be. That was obviously weighing on consumer sentiment. A: There’s a lot to do on fiscal policy in terms of just extending the original Trump tax cuts, which are due to expire at the end of 2025. The debt outlook is approaching 100% of GDP and is on track to be 120% of GDP within another decade. Extending the expiring tax cuts is about avoiding fiscal tightening, not introducing additional stimulus into the economy. We’re not convinced we’ll see further stimulus. A: During his first term, Trump used tariffs as a negotiating tool to draw concessions out of other countries. We’re seeing an echo with recent threats toward Canada, Mexico and China. I think there will be a 10% universal tariff and higher tariffs on China. I don’t think many countries would be able to negotiate their way out of it. This feeds through to final consumer goods prices. It will add up to 1% to inflation. But this is a one-off change rather than an increase in the ongoing inflation rate.  A: It hits the economy’s supply side. But it also hits demand because these people spend money. The question is, which one does it hit most, because that determines whether it’s inflationary or deflationary. Our guess is that the impact on the supply side of the economy will be slightly greater, in which case we see it as slightly inflationary. Some sectors, like agriculture, construction, food processing and restaurants, would get hit harder. That’s where you’d expect inflation to come through — in food prices, restaurant prices. Immigration policies and tariffs could knock half a percent off growth and add 1% to inflation. It’s not ideal. But it’s certainly not a disaster."

        "date": "December 23, 2024",
        "content": "LONDON (AP) — The British economy flatlined in the third quarter of the year, according to downwardly revised official figures Monday, in another blow to the new Labour government that has made growth its number one mission. In its latest revision of the July to September period, the Office for National Statistics said the British economy showed no growth against the previous estimate of 0.1%. The agency partly blamed the reduction on fresh survey data showing weaker trading across bars and restaurants. The reduction has prompted critics to say that Labour talked down the economy on taking power on July 5 for the first time in 14 years when it described its economic inheritance from the previous Conservative administration as being the worst in generations. Treasury chief Rachel Reeves promised to turbocharge economic growth after Labour won the July election but has now seen the economy stall over the three months to September, while official figures earlier this month also pointed towards a 0.1% decline in October. “The challenge we face to fix our economy and properly fund our public finances after 15 years of neglect is huge,” she said. In her first budget in late October, Reeves raised taxes on businesses to help shore up public finances and ailing services. Many economists say the budget has further damaged the British economy as many businesses are responding to the tax rise by either raising prices or reducing employees or wages. Mel Stride, the economy spokesman for the Conservatives, said “warning lights are flashing” on the economy. “Having inherited the fastest-growing economy in the G-7, growth has tanked on Labour’s watch,” Stride said."

        "headline": "Trump was poised to inherit a strong economy. Then things got rocky and he added to the uncertainty",
        "date": "December 20, 2024",
        "content": "▶ Follow live updates on federal funding negotiations as a government shutdown looms. WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — The smooth economy that Donald Trump was poised to inherit suddenly looks a bit rockier — with critics saying the president-elect is contributing to the uncertainty. The Dow Jones stock index essentially ended Thursday flat after having posted 10 days of losses. The Federal Reserve now sees inflation as staying stubbornly elevated as it has become cautious about further interest rate cuts planned for next year. On Wednesday, Trump blew up a bipartisan budget deal , which means the government could shut down after midnight Saturday. He then promoted a deal reached with Republicans on Thursday that Democratic lawmakers and President Joe Biden see as unacceptable. It failed to get the two-thirds threshold needed for House passage. This comes on top of a spate of tariff threats by Trump that the Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday would raise prices and hurt growth without raising enough revenues to cover the rest of his planned tax cuts. As Trump prepares for a second term in the White House, his actions to undo a deal and replace it in under 24 hours test the proposition that markets — a favored Trump barometer of success — will accept his mix of uncertainty and reality TV drama. But from the vantage of Trump world, the economy was already a mess. That’s because of inflation, which is currently 2.7%, and public dissatisfaction with Biden. “On day one, President Trump will get to work to launch the largest deregulatory agenda in history, cut taxes, and expedite permitting for drilling and fracking to lower energy costs and inflation for all Americans,” said Karoline Leavitt, the transition spokeswoman and incoming press secretary. The past few days are a reminder that the economic growth in the Republican’s first term was often accompanied by turmoil. It remains to be seen if voters already exhausted by inflation are ready for another round of blame games and uncertainty that the past few days have foreshadowed. Trump vowed on social media Wednesday to “fight ’till the end” unless Democrats agreed to lift the debt ceiling as a condition for the short-term funding to keep the federal government open. He and his billionaire friend and adviser Elon Musk also promised to fund challengers in the 2026 primary elections to any Republican lawmaker who opposed the president-elect. His social media postings came after Musk blasted the bipartisan package reached by House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to fund the government through March 14. When the government last had a partial shutdown for five weeks starting at the end of 2018, the CBO estimated it cut economic growth by $3 billion , a small but symbolic sum. By Thursday, Trump was claiming on social media that a new deal reached among Republicans was a “SUCCESS” because it would push the debt ceiling out until January 30, 2027. He insisted that Democrats “do what is best for Country,” but the White House and leading Democratic lawmakers came out against the proposal. Democrats were also quick to seize on the seeming Republican dysfunction, with Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., saying, ”Trump’s made a lot of promises, but he’s also going to be accountable for the impact he’s having on families.” “I guess Elon Musk is making the decisions now, because Republicans in Congress are incapable of making decisions on their own,” DelBene said in an interview. “They just wait for someone to tell them what to do.” Trump’s ability to project strength and assure voters that he would reduce inflation helped him win November’s election. Stocks initially climbed on the prospect of tax and regulatory cuts, but Trump still faces a skeptical public and appears to be starting his presidency from a more delicate position than Biden did four years ago. Most U.S. adults — 54% — have an unfavorable view of Trump, according to the latest survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. The survey found that small majorities have slight to no confidence in his ability to manage the White House or government spending. By contrast, Biden began his presidency with an approval rating above 60% only to see it steadily decline as inflation worsened. In a sense, Trump has to preserve the momentum of an economy still recovering from pandemic-era distortions while going through a series of tough policy choices. First, there is the need to increase the government’s legal borrowing authority that he insists be part of any short-term funding bill in order to avoid a shutdown. He will also push to renew his 2017 tax cuts that are set to expire after next year. On top of that, there is a budget deficit that has become less sustainable with higher interest rates. “The U.S. economy is in very good shape — it has a strong underlying growth trend,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economist and president of the American Action Forum, a center-right think tank. “All of the risks are policy risks. They’re risks that the Fed didn’t get it right, risks that come with the clock — we’ve got to do the debt ceiling, we’ve got to fund the government.” In a speech this month at the Brookings Institution, Biden took stock of the roughly 3% economic growth and the inflation rate easing since its 2022 spike, saying Trump would come into office with a solid economy. But he also warned that the policies of Trump allies in the form of tariffs and deportations could unleash an “economic disaster.” The president never translated his investments in infrastructure, renewable energy and new factories into political momentum. But he said “it’s going to be politically costly and economically unsound for the next president to disrupt or cut” those programs. Trump is also inheriting a higher national debt from Biden that could limit the benefits and scope of his planned tax cuts. When he was last president in 2020, the government was spending $345 billion annually to service the debt. That cost now exceeds $1 trillion. On Thursday, the president-elect said on social media that the federal government “will cut Hundreds of Billions of Dollars in spending next year” in an effort to fund his tax cuts and limit deficits. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell told reporters at a Wednesday news conference that some members of the central bank’s rate-setting committee started to incorporate the possible effects of Trump’s policies into their economic forecasts. But Powell stressed that there is a lack of clarity about what Trump would do. It’s unknown whether he would deliver on tariff threats against Canada, Mexico, China and Europe. Nor is there much official guidance on how Trump would fund tax cuts that could add $4.6 trillion to deficits over a decade. “Some did identify policy uncertainty as one of the reasons for their writing down more uncertainty around inflation,” Powell said. “The point about uncertainty is it’s kind of common sense thinking that when the path is uncertain you go a little bit slower.” Powell added for emphasis about what happens with uncertainty: “It’s not unlike driving on a foggy night or walking into a dark room full of furniture. You just slow down.”"

        "date": "December 19, 2024",
        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The American economy grew at a healthy 3.1% annual clip from July through September, propelled by vigorous consumer spending and an uptick in exports, the government said in an upgrade to its previous estimate. Third-quarter growth in U.S. gross domestic product — the economy’s output of goods and services — accelerated from the April-July rate of 3% and continued to look sturdy despite high interest rates , the Commerce Department said Thursday. GDP growth has now topped 2% in eight of the last nine quarters.  Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, expanded at a 3.7% pace, fastest since the first quarter of 2023 and an uptick from Commerce’s previous third-quarter estimate of 3.5%. Exports climbed 9.6%. Business investment grew a lackluster 0.8%, but investment in equipment expanded 10.8%. Spending and investment by the federal government jumped 8.9%, including a 13.9% surge in defense spending. American voters were unimpressed by the steady growth under Democratic President Joe Biden. Exasperated by prices that remain 20% higher than they were when an inflationary surge began in early 2021, they chose last month to send Donald Trump back to the White House with Republican majorities in the House and Senate. Trump will inherit an economy that looks healthy overall. The unemployment rate remains low at 4.2% even though it is up from the 53-year low 3.4% reached in April 2023. Inflation hit a four-decade high 9.1% in mid-2002. Eleven interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve in 2022 and 2023 helped bring it down — to 2.7% last month. That is above the Fed’s 2% target. But the central bank still felt comfortable enough with the progress against inflation to cut its benchmark rate Wednesday for the third time this year.  The president-elect has promised sweeping changes in economic policy, including cutting taxes, imposing big tariffs on foreign goods and deporting millions of immigrants who work in the United States illegally. Many economists fear those policies will fuel higher inflation. “This week’s data show the economy is set to end 2024 on a solid note, which is fortunate since we’ll have to contend with heightened policy uncertainty and possibly greater challenges in 2025,” Oren Klachkin, an economist at Nationwide, wrote in a commentary. Within the GDP data, a category that measures the economy’s underlying strength rose at a solid 3.4% annual rate from July through September, an upgrade from the previous estimate and up from 2.7% in the April-June quarter. This category includes consumer spending and private investment but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending. Wednesday’s report also contained some encouraging news on inflation. The Federal Reserve’s favored inflation gauge — called the personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE — rose at just a 1.5% annual pace last quarter, down from 2.5% in the second quarter. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core PCE inflation was 2.2%, up modestly from the previous estimate but down from 2.8% in the April-June quarter. Thursday’s report was the Commerce Department’s third and final look at third-quarter GDP. It will publish its initial estimate of October-December growth on Jan. 30."

        "date": "December 19, 2024",
        "content": "LONDON (AP) — The U.K.’s central bank warned Thursday of “heightened uncertainty” as it kept interest rates on hold after inflation moved further above target, even at a time when the British economy is flatlining at best. The Bank of England’s nine-member Monetary Policy Committee kept its main interest rate unchanged at 4.75% with new data showing inflation rising to 2.6% , further above the bank’s 2% target. In response the rate-setting panel, which last cut its key rate in November , is taking a cautious stance because lower borrowing costs could potentially stoke inflation even further. The decision was widely anticipated in financial markets yet surprisingly, as many as three of the members voted for a quarter-point cut. That could hint at a further reduction at the next policy meeting in February if there are no big inflation surprises. “We need to make sure we meet the 2% inflation target on a sustained basis,” said Bank Gov. Andrew Bailey, who voted to keep rates on hold. “We think a gradual approach to future interest rate cuts remains right, but with the heightened uncertainty in the economy we can’t commit to when or by how much we will cut rates in the coming year.” Struggling sectors in the U.K. economy and homeowners are hoping for more cuts next year that would provide some relief. The British economy has now contracted for two months in a row.  “The bank’s decision to keep interest rates on hold, while expected, will still come as a palpable blow to households battling with burdensome mortgage bills and businesses facing a jump in costs following the autumn budget,” said Suren Thiru, economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. The bank’s decision arrives a day after the U.S. Federal Reserve reduced interest rates , but Chair Jerome Powell signaled that the Fed would be slowing the pace of rate cuts going forward after inflation forecasts were revised higher. The minutes to the Bank of England’s decision shows that rate-setters cautioned over the economic outlook in the wake of the new Labour government’s first budget and the outcome of the U.S. presidential election. Critics argue that the budget in October has both elevated inflation pressures while also damping growth. A big increase in business taxes may prompt companies to offset higher costs by raising prices or cutting down on hiring. The government argues that it needed to raise taxes to shore up public finances and inject money into cash-starved public services. And with Donald Trump returning to the White House in January, there’s uncertainty as to whether the incoming U.S. administration will impose tariffs on imports, an economic strategy that could lead to a tit-for-tat response that stokes inflation and lowers growth. Still, inflation in the U.K. and across the world is far lower than it was a couple of years ago, partly because central banks dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the coronavirus pandemic when prices started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues and then because of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine which pushed up energy costs. As inflation rates have fallen from multidecade highs, the central banks have started cutting interest rates, though few, if any, economists think that rates will fall back to the super-low levels that persisted in the years after the global financial crisis of 2008-2009."

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — An early rebound for U.S. stocks on Thursday petered out by the end of the day, leaving indexes close to flat. The S&P 500 edged down by 0.1% following Wednesday’s tumble of 2.9% when the Federal Reserve said it may deliver fewer cuts to interest rates next year than earlier thought. The index had been up as much as 1.1% in the morning. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 15 points, or less than 0.1%, following Wednesday’s drop of 1,123 points, while the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.1%. This week’s struggles have taken some of the enthusiasm out of the market, which critics had been warning was overly buoyant and would need everything to go correctly for it to justify its high prices. But indexes remain near their records , and the S&P 500 is still on track for one of its best years of the millennium with a gain of 23%. Traders are now expecting the Federal Reserve to deliver just one or maybe two cuts to interest rates next year, according to data from CME Group. Some are even betting on none. A month ago, the majority saw at least two cuts in 2025 as a safe bet. Wall Street is in recovery mode. We hear more from AP’s Seth Sutel. Wall Street loves lower interest rates because they give the economy a boost and goose prices for investments, but they can also provide fuel for inflation. Micron Technology was one of the heaviest weights on the S&P 500 Thursday. It fell 16.2% despite reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than expected.  The computer memory company’s revenue fell short of Wall Street’s forecasts, and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said it expects demand from consumers to remain weaker in the near term. It gave a forecast for revenue in the current quarter that fell well short of what analysts were thinking. Lamb Weston, which makes French fries and other potato products, dropped 20.1% after falling short of analysts’ expectations for profit and revenue in the latest quarter. It also cut its financial targets for the fiscal year, saying demand for frozen potatoes is continuing to soften, particularly outside North America. The company replaced its chief executive. Such losses helped overshadow a 14.7% jump for Darden Restaurants, the company behind Olive Garden and other chains. It delivered profit for the latest quarter that edged past analysts’ expectations. The operator of LongHorn Steakhouses also gave a forecast for revenue for this fiscal year that topped analysts’. Accenture rose 7.1% after the professional services company likewise topped expectations for profit in the latest quarter. CEO Julie Sweet said it saw growth around the world, and the company raised its forecast for revenue this fiscal year. Amazon shares added 1.3%, even as workers at seven of its facilities went on strike Thursday in the middle of the online retail giant’s busiest time of the year. Amazon says it doesn’t expect an impact on its operations during what the workers’ union calls the largest strike against the company in U.S. history. In the bond market, yields were mixed a day after shooting higher on expectations that the Fed would deliver fewer cuts to rates in 2025. Reports on the U.S. economy came in mixed. One showed the overall economy grew at a 3.1% annualized rate during the summer, faster than earlier thought. The economy has remained remarkably resilient even though the Fed held its main interest rate at a two-decade high for a while before beginning to cut them in September. A separate report showed fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, an indication that the job market also remains solid. But a third report said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region is unexpectedly contracting again despite economists’ expectations for growth. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.57% from 4.52% late Wednesday and from less than 4.20% earlier this month. But the two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for action by the Fed in the near term, eased back to 4.31% from 4.35%. The rise in longer-term yields has put pressure on the housing market by keeping mortgage rates higher. Homebuilder Lennar fell 5.2% after reporting weaker profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Stuart Miller said that “the housing market that appeared to be improving as the Fed cut short-term interest rates, proved to be far more challenging as mortgage rates rose” through the quarter. “Even while demand remained strong, and the chronic supply shortage continued to drive the market, our results were driven by affordability limitations from higher interest rates,” he said. A report on Thursday may have offered some encouragement for the housing industry. It showed a pickup in sales of previously occupied homes. All told, the S&P 500 slipped 5.08 points to 5,867.08. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 15.37 to 42,342.24, and the Nasdaq composite lost 19.92 to 19,372.77. In stock markets abroad, London’s FTSE 100 fell 1.1% after the Bank of England paused its cuts to rates and kept its main interest rate unchanged on Thursday. The move comes as inflation there moved further above the central bank’s 2% target rate, while the British economy is flatlining at best. The Bank of Japan also kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged, and Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.7%. Indexes likewise sank across much of the rest of Asia and Europe.

        "headline": "China retail sales slow as consumers hold back, while home prices fall",
        "date": "December 16, 2024",
        "content": "BANGKOK (AP) — Chinese retail sales slowed in November and housing prices fell, the government said Monday, with demand still lackluster despite a flurry of stimulus measures over the past few months. The report came just a few days after top leaders ended an annual planning meeting in Beijing that produced no major new policy initiatives but included promises to do more to encourage people and businesses to spend more more. Analysts said ruling Communist Party leaders were leaving room to do more if U.S. President-elect Donald Trump delivers on his promises to raise tariffs on imports from China once he takes office. The National Bureau of Statistics reported that the economy was stable, with the unemployment remaining at 5%. “However, we must also see that the external environment is more complicated, domestic demand is insufficient, some enterprises are facing difficulties in production and operation, and the foundation for the sustained recovery of the economy still needs to be consolidated,” Fu Linghui, a spokesperson for the National Bureau of Statistics, told reporters. Retail sales rose 3% from a year earlier, down from October’s 4.8% increase and below the 3.5% annual rate in January-November. Consumers held back on spending on non-essentials like cosmetics, alcohol and clothing, though purchases of appliances and vehicles surged thanks to a government program to pay subsidies to entice people to replace older appliances and cars with newer, energy efficient versions and electric vehicles.  Auto sales rose 6.6% in November over a year earlier, but have fallen 0.7% year-on-year so far this year. Sales of appliances jumped more than 22%, and have climbed 9.6% so far this year. The cash-for-clunkers and appliance recycling programs have helped keep factories humming, as has President Xi Jinping’s emphasis on building up high-tech industries for “high-quality” development. That has supported manufacturing: growth in factory output ticked up to 5.4% year-on-year from 5.3% in October. Chinese leaders pledged to take a more proactive approach in pepping up the economy after their two-day planning meeting last week, but gave no details on stimulus measures. Also Monday, the government announced a plan to upgrade the entire retail system in the coming five years, saying projects to revamp retail outlets would be rolled out across the country, providing “business landmarks” including shopping, food and entertainment venues. The plans as outlined in state media make no mention of the key factors that economists say are leading many Chinese families to scrimp and save rather than spend: insecurity about jobs, weaker prices for property and other assets and low incomes. “Ultimately, consumption will be driven by income growth and the propensity to save,” Oxford Economics said in a report. “The outlook for the former is cautious and savings are being driven by concerns about the economic outlook.” Investment in fixed assets like factories and in housing construction slowed in November. Property prices fell and home sales also declined in most cities, the statistics bureau said, as China endures a downturn in its real estate market after regulators cracked down on excessive borrowing by developers that plunged the whole industry into crisis. The disruptions to jobs and businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic have further weighed on the world’s second-largest economy. “China’s economy appears to have slowed last month, despite tailwinds from recent policy easing,” Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a report. “Growth still looks on course to pick up this quarter, but the disappointing November data underscores the challenge policymakers face in engineering a sustained rebound in growth.” Chinese stocks had climbed recently on renewed hopes for a stronger dose of stimulus to help counter the weak consumer sentiment that has kept the economy growing this year at a rate slightly slower than the government’s official target of about 5%. On Monday, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index fell 1% while the Shanghai Composite index slipped 0.2%. The Hang Seng property index fell 1.3%. Evans-Pritchard said the impacts of a raft of policies to ease credit and support the economy would likely pick up in coming months. “But we doubt that stimulus can deliver anything more than a short-lived improvement, not least because the current strength of export demand is unlikely to last once President Trump starts to put some of his tariff threats into action.” Associated Press researcher Yu Bing contributed."

        "content": "BANGKOK (AP) — Chinese leaders wrapped up a two-day planning meeting in Beijing on Thursday with pledges to take a more proactive approach in pepping up the world’s second-largest economy, but gave no details on new stimulus measures. A state-run CCTV report on the annual meeting mainly reiterated a strategy outlined earlier in the week after a session of the ruling Communist Party’s powerful Politburo at which leaders pledged to loosen monetary policy and adopt a more proactive fiscal approach. Markets in China have climbed recently on renewed hopes for a stronger dose of stimulus to help counter weak consumer spending that has kept the economy growing this year at a rate slightly slower than the government’s official target of about 5%. The promise of “moderately loose” monetary policy showed a shift from a more cautious “prudent” approach that had prevailed for a decade, after China’s recovery from the global financial crisis. But so far, the measures taken this year to jolt the economy out of its post-pandemic doldrums have been broad in scope but more incremental and technical than the dramatic stimulus that investors have been hoping for. The CCTV report said China would raise its fiscal deficit and continue to issue “super-long” government bonds to help finance additional spending. It gave no details on the amount of money to be spent or size of the deficit.  Leaders pledged to stabilize the property market, which has been mired in a downturn after a crackdown several years ago on excess borrowing by property developers. They also promised to boost consumer spending by countering weakness in the job market and seeing that wages keep pace with economic growth. The party also was drafting longer-term strategies for the country’s next five-year plan, which will provide a blueprint for policies in the coming years that will likely align with President Xi Jinping’s emphasis on developing advanced technologies and “higher quality” growth. Several months ago, the Chinese central bank and other regulators began rolling out various policies aimed at encouraging businesses and households to spend more money. A statement issued after the Politburo meeting mostly reiterated the same broad promises. Beijing also has launched programs to pay subsidies for trade-ins of old cars and appliances that are replaced by new, more energy efficient ones. The scheme has helped boost auto sales, one of the brighter areas of the economy, according to the Chinese Association of Automobile Manufacturers. The industry body said this week that passenger car sales jumped 17.5% in November compared to a year ago, the second straight month of double-digit growth following a 10.7% rise in October. “We continue to call for the extension of relevant policies that promote auto consumption,” the association said, noting positive policy signals from the Politburo meeting. Exports have also shown signs of strength, though rising tariffs imposed on electric vehicles and other Chinese products pose a threat to trade-led growth. Meanwhile, the property market has shown signs of recovering from its prolonged downturn, though economists say a full recovery will take time.

        "date": "December 11, 2024",
        "content": "BANGKOK (AP) — Myanmar’s economy is forecast to contract this year, the World Bank said Wednesday, as flooding and fighting take a severe toll nearly four years after the military ousted its elected government headed by Aung San Suu Kyi. In an update issued Wednesday, the bank said about a fifth of all built structures and a tenth of Myanmar’s roads had been damaged by widespread flooding during heavy monsoon rains and a typhoon that swept through the country in September. About 2 million people were left homeless, the report said. Meanwhile, fighting between the military and opposition forces remains fierce in some parts of the country, disrupting farming and manufacturing. “The level and intensity of armed conflict remains high, severely affecting lives and livelihoods, disrupting production and supply chains, and heightening uncertainty around the economic outlook,” it said. Overall, the report said the economy will likely contract 1% in annual terms in the April-March fiscal year. Pro-democracy guerrillas and ethnic minority armed forces seeking autonomy have been battling the Myanmar army after it took power in early 2021, when generals ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi The United Nations estimates that 3.5 million people, or about 6% of the population, have been displaced from their homes, more than half the country’s townships are embroiled in conflict and construction of major projects has been delayed, the report said.  The U.N. special envoy for Myanmar recently warned that the Southeast Asian nation is in crisis, with conflict escalating , criminal networks “out of control” and human suffering at unprecedented levels. Julie Bishop, a former Australian foreign minister, warned that Myanmar risks becoming a “forgotten crisis.” Adding to the troubles, disruptions from the conflict have helped to undermine the value of Myanmar’s currency, the kyat, which lost 40% of its value against the dollar in informal trading in the first eight months of the year, the World Bank report said. That helped push inflation to more than 25%, while food prices increased more than 60% between April and September, it said. Arrivals of international tourists are at about one-fifth the level before double shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic and the military takeover, and manufacturing has also weakened as electricity blackouts disrupt production. Myanmar’s military administration stopped publishing trade data in mid-2024, the report said, but an analysis of data from its trading partners showed that garments and natural gas exports, which account for a large share of all its exports, fell more than 11% in April-September from a year earlier. The report’s assessment of the outlook was for a further deterioration in conditions if fighting intensifies."

        "content": "BANGKOK (AP) — China’s top leaders have pledged to loosen monetary policy and provide more support for the slowing economy, while Premier Li Qiang swiped at threats of higher tariffs on Chinese exports , saying they hinder global growth. Shares in Hong Kong jumped Monday after state media released a report on the meeting by the ruling Communist Party’s Politburo that said leaders would “implement more active fiscal policies and moderately loose monetary policies.” The shift to “moderately loose” from the “prudent” monetary policies of the past 14 years was taken as a significant shift by market players, unleashing a spate of buying that pushed the Hang Seng index up 2.8%. “This marks a significant recalibration in their approach, aiming to cushion the anticipated economic shocks” (from higher tariffs), Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. Several months ago, the Chinese central bank and other regulators began rolling out various policies aimed at encouraging businesses and households to spend more money. Overall, Monday’s statement mostly reiterated the same broad promises as usual. “The readout leaves little doubt that the shift toward a more supportive policy stance that began in September is still alive and well,” Julian Evans-Pritchard said in a report. He noted that the last such shift was in late 2008, during the global financial crisis, and that it may be followed by faster interest rate cuts in the coming year.  Monday’s meeting has set the tone for an annual economic planning meeting later in the week that will reaffirm policies for the coming year. China’s economy has growing a bit more slowly than the official target for a 5% expansion in annual terms this year, and the property market is still in the doldrums. Consumer spending remains subdued, having never fully recovered after the COVID-19 pandemic, and the statement from the Politburo meeting promised a “combination punch” of government spending and easier credit to help boost consumption. Consumer inflation in November was a lower-than-expected 0.2%, the government reported Monday, down from 0.3% the month before mainly due to lower food prices. That leaves ample room for interest rate cuts, analysts said. With youth unemployment still relatively high and many households feeling the pinch of lower housing prices and unstable jobs, the statement called for improving the “people’s sense of gain, happiness and security.” “We must do a good job in people’s livelihood protection and security and stability the ensure the stability of the overall social situation,” it said. Also Monday, Li, who as premier has the traditional role of overseeing the economy, met with heads of the World Bank and other big international financial organizations. Li did not refer to the United States by name, but took aim at countries that restrict trade through higher tariffs and other measures, in a veiled slam at Washington at a time when the U.S. has been tightening controls on exports of advanced technology, while President-elect Donald Trump is threatening to sharply hike import duties on Chinese products. “If we look at the obstacles to economic globalization, some countries now easily resort to imposing additional high tariffs, erecting barriers of protection. There are more and more restrictive measures on trade,” Li said. “The reason why I’m talking about this issue is that under the background of weak economic growth of the world, this issue has further increased uncertainties and caused huge interference to the operation of the global economy,” he added."

        "date": "February 24, 2025",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Paul Safarik, 32, of Lincoln, Nebraska, has worked in the food industry since he was 21, delivering for quick service restaurants like Raising Cane’s and stocking groceries at stores like Trader Joe’s. With his earnings, Safarik, who has Down syndrome, recently bought a treadmill to stay active when the weather’s bad and helped cover the cost of braces for his teeth. That’s unusual, financially speaking, and it’s thanks in part to a little-known savings account called an ABLE account, which lets people people with disabilities save money beyond the $2,000 asset limit that’s linked to benefits like Supplemental Security Income and Medicaid . Without the account, Safarik could have risked losing government assistance if he had more than $2,000 in assets saved at one time in a given month. “With this ABLE account, we don’t have to worry as much,” said Deb Safarik, 71, Paul’s mother, with whom he lives. “It’s nice that he can work and save, and not have that be held against him.” Named for the 2014 law that created them, the Achieving a Better Life Experience Act, ABLE accounts have been available since 2016 to individuals identified by a doctor as having a disability before the age of 26. Next year, they’ll become available to those identified before the age of 46, which will increase access to an additional 6 million people, including 1 million veterans, according to Indiana State Treasurer Daniel Elliott, who administers the accounts in his state. An estimated 8 million people nationwide already qualify. “The fact that it used to be that individuals could only save up to $2,000 or they could lose benefits — that was really restricting a lot of families,” Elliot said. “People were forced into a position where they couldn’t save for their futures. Now we’re seeing average account balances of (ABLE accounts) between $11,000 and $12,000.”  Generally, ABLE accounts may reach totals of $100,000 without affecting Supplemental Security Income. Lifetime balance limits for the various state ABLE accounts can range from around $300,000 to over $500,000. They’re administered by state treasurers, and the vast majority can be set up online via their websites. Some ABLE plans accept paper applications as well. Anyone can contribute to an ABLE account — including the account owner, friends, family, organizations, nonprofits, and employers — up to $19,000 per year in 2025. If the account owner is able to work and not already contributing to a workplace retirement plan, they can contribute an additional amount equal to their yearly gross income. For 2025, that amount is up to an additional $15,560 to $18,810, depending on the state administering the account. There are also tax advantages. Investment earnings from ABLE accounts remain untaxed as long as money taken from the account is used for “qualified disability expenses,” such as medical treatment, education, tutoring and job training. Account holders may choose from a number of investment options for the funds in their accounts or hold and save the money without investing it further. Elliot said raising awareness of the accounts is the biggest challenge for the National Association of State Treasurers (NAST), for which he’s also the secretary treasurer. “Many people are used to the idea that, ‘If I have a disability or my child has one, it could endanger their benefits to save money,’” he said. “We as a state and as a country need to start reaching out to people and saying, ‘Look, you actually can save money now. You could save towards the purchase of a home.’ The hardest thing right now is getting that message out. We need more people to be aware things have changed.” According to NAST’s data, just 186,641 ABLE accounts existed at the end of 2024, despite an estimated 8 million people qualifying. When the age limit is raised, the accounts will also become available to people whose disabilities may have been the result of an accident in adulthood or developed later in life, such as after a COVID infection. Andrew Warren, senior associate for policy and research at the Financial Health Network, who studies the financial circumstances of Americans with disabilities, said that the vast majority of people surveyed for a 2023 report by the organization did not know these accounts existed. “Less than 1% of eligible individuals have these accounts,” Warren said. “Our research show that one of the major barriers to becoming financially healthy for this vulnerable group is asset limits. But there’s an information disconnect between caseworkers and direct services providers on the ground and (administrators of ABLE accounts).” Here’s what to know: Two online resources — ABLE Today and the ABLE National Resource Center — can guide you through questions to determine if you or a friend or family member qualifies. Right now, ABLE accounts are for: — People whose disability began before age 26, and — People for whom the disability is “terminal or long-term (more than 12 months)” and for whom the disability causes “marked and severe functional limitations.” A qualifying person must also meet one of the following criteria: — Being eligible for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) because of the disability; or — A doctor has diagnosed the disability (physical or mental). In 2026, the age limit for ABLE accounts will rise to 46. You can begin educating yourself now about the process of setting up the account, so you can add money and fund the account right away beginning in January 2026. Family, friends, and organizations may also begin setting money aside with the intention of contributing it to the account in the individual’s name as of January 1.

        "headline": "What does having the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on hold mean for consumers?",
        "date": "February 12, 2025",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which Congress established to monitor credit card companies, mortgage providers, debt collectors and other segments of the consumer finance industry, is the latest U.S. government agency to have its work halted by the Trump administration. Conservatives have long targeted the work of the CFPB. Critics complain the independent agency, funded by the Federal Reserve System , lacks sufficient supervision and regularly exceeds its regulatory authority. Defenders argue the bureau’s watchdog mission has strong bipartisan support. Here’s some background on the scope of the CFPB’s activities and how the agency’s tenuous status might affect consumers: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is charged with creating rules and taking enforcement actions to protect consumers from unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices by a wide range of financial institutions and businesses. Its actions involve banks, mortgage servicers, credit card companies, student loan processors, payday lenders, money transfer providers, credit reporting agencies and debt collectors. During the Biden administration, the CFPB passed rules capping bank overdraft fees and removing medical debt from credit reports. The bureau sued financial services companies for misleading consumers and employers for misleading workers. It also focused on curbing junk fees and predatory lending practices. Congress established the agency as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The legislation was intended to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis and subprime mortgage-lending scandal. The CFPB says it has obtained nearly $20 billion for consumers since then in the form of monetary compensation, canceled debts, reduced loans and other financial relief. Russell Vought, the newly installed director of the Office of Management and Budget, told the CFPB last weekend to stop its investigations and work on proposed rules. He instructed the agency to suspend the enforcement dates of any rules that had been finalized but not yet put into effect, and closed the CFPB’s offices for a week. Vought sent an email to employees on Monday morning saying they should “not perform any work tasks.” They were directed to contact the top lawyer for the Office of Management and Budget “to get approval in writing” before doing anything. Vought also said in a social media post that the agency would not withdraw its next round of funding from the Federal Reserve, which Congress assigned as the CFPB’s funding source to avoid the political wrangling of the congressional appropriations process. Two top officials resigned Tuesday in protest. Also Tuesday, Trump named Jonathan McKernan, a former Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation board member, as the agency’s new director . Before Trump took office, banks and industry groups sometimes sued to block some of the agency’s rules. For example, when the CFPB issued a rule in 2017 to limit the number of payments the providers of payday loans, vehicle title loans, and high-cost installment loans could take from customer bank accounts, trade associations for payday lenders challenged the bureau’s Federal Reserve funding as unconstitutional. In May 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected their argument and upheld the CFPB’s funding and oversight model. Trump on Monday defended his administration’s efforts to reform the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, saying the agency was “set up to destroy people.” The overdraft fee rule was finalized and set to take effect in October, but Vought’s directive puts it on hold. Banks had previously sued to get the rule thrown out. The rule would require the largest banks to pick one of three options: to reduce overdraft fees to $5, to reduce them to a rate that reflects how much an overdraft costs them, or to disclose, along with the fee, the fee’s Annual Percent Rate (APR) as they do with other short-term loans. Overdraft fees currently run about $35 on average. The CFPB finalized a rule in January that would remove medical debt from credit reports . The agency had said the change could potentially improve the credit scores of millions of people and make it easier for them to get mortgages and other loans. The rule was set to take effect 60 days after its publication in the Federal Register but is now suspended. It also was the subject of a legal challenge. “President Trump campaigned on lowering prices, and a lot of people voted for him because of high prices. and yet we’re seeing Republicans move to make them pay high overdraft fees and pay more for loans on their credit,” said Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center. “The public broadly thinks that overdraft fees are unfair and medical debt shouldn’t be on credit reports. If you ask ordinary people, these are not partisan issues.” Lindsey Johnson, president and CEO of the Consumer Bankers Association, characterized the CFPB’s work under Biden as “aggressive.” She said the agency took action in recent years without going through the appropriate procedures. “We don’t believe they had the proper oversight,” she said. Miranda Margowsky, a spokesperson for the Financial Technology Association, an industry group that counts many financial technology companies as members, said her organization anticipates and hopes several CFPB rules, including those governing “buy now, pay later” plans and other fintech products, will be reversed “with the stroke of a pen.” She characterized the rules as “overly broad, overreaching, and harmful.” Supporters of the CFPB protested outside the bureau’s shuttered Washington headquarters this week. NAACP President Derrick Johnson and others have demanded the office’s reopening. “The CFPB has provided crucial protections against big banks and lenders,” Johnson said in a statement. “Without this critical oversight, consumers — especially Black and Brown communities — will be vulnerable to fraud, predatory lending, and discriminatory financial practices.” Kitty Richards, senior strategic advisor at the advocacy group Groundwork Collaborative, said consumers today are more vulnerable to data privacy violations, junk fees, and financial scams. Without the CFPB, corporations are “freer to prey on the American people without fearing they might have to give back the money,” she said.

        "headline": "Tax season has begun. Here’s when you’ll get your refund",
        "date": "January 29, 2025",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Tax season is underway, and the IRS expects 140 million people will file returns by April 15. The agency has also debuted a new online tool to help taxpayers check the status of any refund they may be entitled to. President Donald Trump this week offered all federal employees a buyout package in an effort to reduce the size of the government workforce, which could impact IRS staffing at an important period for the agency, though it’s not yet clear how. The IRS did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Here’s what to know: If you file your tax return electronically, the IRS says it should take 21 days or less to receive your refund. If you choose to receive your refund with direct deposit, it should take even less time. If you file a paper return, the refund could take four weeks or more, and if your return requires amendments or corrections, it could take longer. The IRS cautions taxpayers not to rely on receiving a refund by a certain date, especially when making major purchases or paying bills.  Taxpayers can use the online tool Where’s My Refund? to check the status of their income tax refund within 24 hours of e-filing and generally within four weeks of filing a paper return. Information related to this tool is updated once daily, overnight. To access the status of your refund, you’ll need: — Your Social Security or individual taxpayer ID number (ITIN) — Your filing status — The refund amount calculated on your return If you paid more through the year than you owe in tax, due to withholding or other reasons, you should get money back. Even if you didn’t pay excess tax, you may still get a refund if you qualify for a refundable credit, like the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) or Child Tax Credit. To get your refund, you must file a return, and you have three years to claim a tax refund. To qualify for the EITC, you must have under $11,600 in investment income and earn less than a specific income level from working. If you’re single with no children, your income level must be $18,591 or below. And if you’re married filing jointly with three or more children, you must make $66,819 or below. To determine if your household qualifies based on your marital status and your number of dependents you can use the online EITC Assistant tool. If you have a child, you are most likely eligible for the Child Tax Credit. The credit is up to $2,000 per qualifying child. To qualify, a child must: — Have a Social Security number — Be under age 17 at the end of 2024 — Be claimed as a dependent on your tax return You qualify for the full amount of the Child Tax Credit for each qualifying child if you meet all eligibility factors and your annual income is not more than $200,000 ($400,000 if filing a joint return). The IRS has expanded a program that allows people to file their taxes directly with the agency for free. The federal Direct File program , which permits taxpayers to calculate and submit their returns without using commercial tax preparation software, is now available to taxpayers in 25 states, up from 12 states that were part of last year’s pilot program. The program allows people in some states with very simple W-2s to calculate and submit their returns directly to the IRS. Those using the pilot program in 2024 claimed more than $90 million in refunds, the IRS said in October.

        "date": "January 21, 2025",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — If you live in a part of the world prone to wildfires , floods, blizzards, tornadoes, or earthquakes, there are ways you can make sure you’re financially prepared for disaster, beyond insurance . The Federal Emergency Management Association and the Red Cross advise that households gather important documents and contacts in a safe place, take photographs or record a video of the rooms in your home and any valuable belongings, and to have cash on hand, in case ATMs and electronic or online banking resources aren’t available, among other guidance. Lisa Berdie, director of policy and research for the Financial Health Network, an organization that focuses on underserved consumers, refers to these steps as “preparedness,” but stresses the need for “investments in efforts to lessen the severity of climate impacts, reduce risks, and minimize financial harm.” “Key here is recognizing that it is not just the headline-grabbing events, but smaller-scale events and chronic stressors (for example, heat) that have dramatic financial consequences for households,” Berdie said. “Some of the action steps that households can consider (there)... include weatherizing homes and addressing health hazards that are worsened by climate hazards, like mold and air quality.” Here’s what you can do to be more financially prepared and organized in case of disaster: According to FEMA, the first thing to do is compile important documents. These include: birth and marriage certificates, social security cards, military service records and your pet’s ID tags, microchip and vaccination records. Other documents to have organized include: housing payments, utility bills, credit/debit card information, receipts from child support, checking, savings, and retirement account numbers, insurance policies, paystubs, tax statements, and wills, according to FEMA. Medical information to have on hand includes: health insurance and pharmacy cards, records of immunizations and allergies, copies of prescriptions, and records of medical devices or equipment for disabilities. Also make records of important contacts, such as: 1. Landlord or mortgage representatives 2. Doctors, dentists, or other health care providers 3. Insurance agents 4. Representatives in charge of military benefits and social and disability services 5. Assistive technology or medical equipment providers 6. Lawyers 7. Financial advisors 8. Banking institutions 9. Neighborhood, civic, and house of worship contacts “Make sure you store important phone numbers somewhere besides just your cell phone,” FEMA advises. When you apply for disaster assistance, you may need to show proof of ID or income. You may also need to re-establish financial accounts if checks are destroyed or if online access is down. Other records can help you prove the identity of household members, maintain or re-establish contact with family and friends, maintain contact with employers, and apply for other forms of assistance. If you don’t have an original version of a document listed above, contact the appropriate company or agency to request a copy. If you receive paper checks for any federal benefits, consider enrolling in automatic benefits, and if you receive paper checks from an employer, consider requesting direct deposit or prepaid debit cards. FEMA also advises printing or downloading statements of any bills paid automatically, such as rent or mortgage payments, utilities, loan payments, and membership fees. Downloading banking and bill payment apps for your phone can also help you stay mobile in times of emergency. Photographing or recording a video of the rooms in your home and any valuable belongings is also advisable as a form of record keeping. FEMA and the Red Cross advise individuals to keep cash in the same safe location as one’s important documents to pay for emergency purchases in the event that ATMs aren’t functioning or banks are closed. The amount of cash should be based on the basic needs of your family, including gas, food, and medications. Review insurance policies and financial paperwork to be sure they’re accurate and current — that includes homeowners, auto, and renters insurance. Store paper and electronic copies of all files in safe locations. Consider keeping paper copies in a fireproof and waterproof box or safe, a bank safe deposit box, or with a trusted friend or relative. If you’re already using a safe deposit box, check state laws to confirm who can and can’t access the safe if the owner dies or can’t access it themselves due to injury or illness, FEMA advises. To store electronic copies of important documents, use a password-protected format on a flash or external hard drive, which you can also keep in the fireproof, waterproof box. Revisit and update your documents regularly. Updates are especially important when significant changes in your life occur, such as: when your insurance changes, when you move, open or close bank accounts, become married or divorced, when you have a child, when your child changes schools, during retirement planning, and if there’s a death in the household.

        "headline": "After disasters, people are especially vulnerable to scams. Here’s how to protect yourself",
        "date": "January 13, 2025",
        "content": "▶ Follow live updates on the Los Angeles wildfires . NEW YORK (AP) — During natural disasters like wildfires and floods, scammers often emerge to prey on victims. People in heightened emotional states in the wake of a catastrophic event should be extra careful of impersonators asking for identifying details, according to Karina Layugan, an attorney with the Federal Trade Commission based in Los Angeles, where firefighters in the region are battling blazes that have already destroyed thousands of homes and killed at least 24 people. Scammers sometimes pretend to be from the utility company or the Federal Emergency Management Agency and ask to “verify information.” If someone uses that phrase, ask why the individual needs that information and “always contact the company or agency directly,” she said. That’s information those organizations should already have. “It’s something that’s unfortunately very common,” Layugan said. “After disasters, people are also particularly vulnerable to people saying you need to ‘act fast’ and using urgency to pressure people into taking actions that might not be in their best interest.” Layugan stresses that FEMA will never charge fees for applications for aid, and that people should be skeptical of anyone “who says they’ll help others get FEMA relief soon and who charges up-front fees.” The same goes for contractors. “After a disaster, people looking to rebuild will get a flood of contractors coming to them and saying they can help and they ‘know the system.’ Sometimes they’re looking for a quick payout,” Layugan said. “Be skeptical of anyone who promises immediate clean-up or immediate repairs. Oftentimes those types of individuals seek cash payments up front or do things without written contracts. Be very wary if anyone who wants cash up front or who urges you to ‘act immediately.’”  Online review sites and searches for the contractor’s name with the word “scam” or “complaints” can help, as can confirming the license and insurance information of anyone you work with. “Always do your own research and get a second estimate,” Layugan said. In 2023 alone, roughly 1 million people reported identity theft, 2.6 million people reported fraud, and 1.9 million reported other types of scams to the FTC. Here are some ways to protect yourself from identity theft and scams, especially after disasters: It can take time to realize your data has been stolen . According to the FTC, signs include: — A phone, electricity, or gas account opened in your name — Debt collection calls for accounts you didn’t open — Bills for things you didn’t buy — Medical bills or insurance charges for procedures you didn’t have — Inaccurate information on your credit report — Denial of loan applications — Mail that stops coming to, or is missing from, your mailbox — A missing tax refund or government benefits If you notice any of the above, here’s what to do: Contact: — The FTC online at IdentityTheft.gov or call 1-877-438-4338. The FTC will provide you with an individualized recovery plan. Prompts and questions will ask you how the thief has used your data — whether to open credit card accounts, get a car loan or lease in your name, or to file for government benefits. — The three major credit reporting agencies : Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian. Ask them to place fraud alerts and a credit freeze on your accounts to prevent further misuse of your data. — The fraud department at your credit card issuers, bank, and other places where you have accounts, such as a medical insurance account. By acting quickly, you can prevent consequences to your credit score and financial health. False information on your credit report can cause lasting damage if not addressed promptly. After you’ve done the above, continue to review credit card and bank account statements. Watch for and report any unauthorized or suspicious transactions. The FTC recommends doing the following to keep your personal identity safe: — Collect your mail every day and place a hold on your mail when you’ll be on vacation or away. — Store personal information, including your Social Security card, in a safe place. Do not carry it in your wallet. — Never share your bank account number or Social Security number, especially over the phone to unknown callers or via email or text. While disasters can lead scammers to take advantage of vulnerable groups by impersonating representatives from relief and government agencies, or with contracting scams, other types of fraud and impersonation can also surround these events. If you’re already feeling vulnerable, you may be more likely to fall for other types of fraud, such as: — Tax and medical information theft Medical ID theft and tax ID theft are common forms of identity theft, especially during tax season and Medicare re-enrollment periods.

        "headline": "IRS is sending out automatic stimulus payments. Who is getting them?",
        "date": "January 13, 2025",
        "content": "The IRS is distributing about $2.4 billion to taxpayers who didn’t receive their COVID stimulus payments. By the end of January, approximately 1 million taxpayers will receive special payments of up to $1,400 from the IRS. The IRS said it’s distributing these payments to taxpayers who failed to claim a Recovery Rebate Credit on their 2021 tax returns. The Recovery Rebate Credit is a refundable credit for individuals who did not receive one or more Economic Impact Payments (EIP), also known as stimulus payments. “Looking at our internal data, we realized that one million taxpayers overlooked claiming this complex credit when they were actually eligible,” IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said in a statement. One taxpayer who benefitted was Ginny Bultman, 61, from Colorado. Bultman and her husband didn’t receive a stimulus payment back in 2021. After reading about the latest IRS payments, she realized she qualified for the Recovery Rebate Credit. A day later, she got her check in the mail. “It was a pleasant surprise,” said Bultman, who owns a locksmith business in her town. The Bultman family received three late stimulus payments, including one for their underaged son, which amounted to $4,200 at the end of December. Here’s what you need to know about the IRS payments. The special payments announced by the IRS are being sent to those taxpayers who filed a 2021 tax return but left the data field for the Recovery Rebate Credit blank or they filled it out as $0 when they were actually eligible for the credit.  Payments will vary but the maximum amount will be $1,400 per individual. In total, the IRS will be distributing about $2.4 billion to taxpayers who failed to claim a Recovery Rebate Credit on their 2021 tax returns. The IRS has posted information online about eligibility and how the payment was calculated. The Recovery Rebate Credit is a refundable credit for individuals who didn’t receive the Economic Impact Payments, also known as stimulus payments, during 2020 and 2021. The IRS announced this initiative after reviewing its internal data and finding that many eligible taxpayers who filed a 2021 tax return didn’t claim the credit. “To minimize headaches and get this money to eligible taxpayers, we’re making these payments automatic, meaning these people will not be required to go through the extensive process of filing an amended return to receive it,” said Werfel. If you qualify for the Recovery Rebate Credit you don’t have to take any action. The IRS plans to send letters to eligible taxpayers notifying them of the special payment. The payments will go out automatically this month and should arrive by direct deposit or check by late January. They’ll be sent to the bank account listed on the taxpayer’s 2023 return or to the address IRS has on file. You still might be able to receive the money. However, taxpayers need to file a tax return and claim the Recovery Rebate Credit by the April 15, 2025 deadline, even if any income from a job, business or other source was minimal or nonexistent, according to the IRS. There were three rounds of payments to households impacted by the pandemic, totaling $814 billion. IRS based the amounts that taxpayers received on their income, tax filing status and number of children or qualifying dependents. In March 2020, eligible individuals received up to $1,200 per income tax filer and $500 per child under the CARES Act. In December 2020, eligible individuals received up to $600 per income tax filer and $600 per child under the Consolidated Appropriations Act. In March 2021, eligible individuals received up to $1,400 per income tax filer and $1,400 per child under the American Rescue Plan Act.

        "headline": "Here’s what you need to know about credit card defaults",
        "date": "January 09, 2025",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Credit card defaults are on the rise for Americans, reaching the highest level in 14 years. U.S. credit card defaults jumped to a record $46 billion from January through September 2024, according to the Financial Times, citing data analyzed by BankRegData. With high levels of credit card debt and high inflation, many consumers have found themselves unable to cover monthly payments, leading some to default. A borrower goes into default when they miss credit card payments for over 180 days, roughly six months. When there is a failure to pay over such a long period, banks generally take this as a sign that a borrower won’t pay the debt anymore, said Matt Sotir, financial advisor with Equitable Advisors based in New Hampshire. Defaulting on credit card debt can have serious consequences, including a negative impact on credit reports that lead to a long-lasting effect on the ability to borrow money, said Sotir. “These are debts that have a lot of impact and I think sometimes people don’t realize that if they missed (a payment), how bad it could be for them in other areas,” added Sotir. Here’s what you should know about credit card defaults.  There are several levels of consequences when credit card payments are not made. It begins with late fees, higher interest rates and a potentially lower credit score. If a borrower doesn’t pay for 30 days the bank considers the credit card “delinquent” and the borrower’s credit scores can be damaged further. When a borrower fails to make a payment for roughly six months, the bank considers the credit card in default, which means they will close your account and refer you to a collection agency, said Chip Lupo, writer at WalletHub. “That’s where you’re going to really have trouble obtaining future credit for a while,” said Lupo. When a collection agency assumes your debt, they will reach out via phone, email and mail to encourage you to pay up. Eventually, if not paid, the collection agency may take legal action against the borrower. The first step is to be proactive, recommended Sotir. Whether it’s reaching out to your bank or working with a financial advisor, the quicker you start looking for viable solutions the more consequences you will be able to avoid. “I’ve seen it over the years, when someone gets in trouble, it’s easy to cocoon and not want to deal with it,” said Sotir Sotir and Bandebo recommend that you reach out to your credit card company to negotiate the debt since it’s in the bank’s best interest to help you catch up. If your account goes to a collections agency, find out if they can offer a payment plan or seek help from a non-profit credit counseling organization or financial advisor. It’s best if you pay your credit card in full every month, but if that is not possible, gettting to at least the minimum monthly payment each month can help you avoid falling further into debt, said Rikard Bandebo, chief economist at VantageScore, a credit modeling company. “Do whatever you can not to get to the next stage. If you’re 30 days late, try to avoid getting to 60 days and absolutely try to do everything you can to avoid getting default,” said Bandebo. If you are having trouble making payments on your credit card, Bandebo recommends you reach out to your bank and ask if you can be placed in a payment plan. Other alternatives include reaching out to a credit counseling organization or transferring your credit card debt to a 0% interest card, though that typically comes with a fee. Defaulting on a credit card will mean serious consequences for your credit score, and that will limit how much you will be able to borrow in the future, and how much it will cost you. If you don’t pay your credit card bill for a month, your credit score will likely fall between 60 and 100 points, said Bandebo. While there is not an specific amount of points that your credit score will fall should you default, it will appear on your credit report for seven years, added Bandebo. Bandebo often uses the analogy of credit scores being similar to reputation; it takes a long time to build up but one mistake to set you back for a long time. “There’s not miracle solutions that once you’ve missed a payment, or you’ve gone to default, to simple go back to where you were. You can’t just flip a switch,” said Bandebo. If you find that you cannot regularly make payments to your credit cards, Sotir recommends you start by looking at your budget to find which expenses can be cut, and or considering whether you need an extra source of income. “For most people, it’s really about understanding how much money is coming in and where it’s going,” added Sotir. If your expenses outweigh your income, Sotir recommends looking for a temporary second job, find if you have assets that you can sell, or asking family if they can help you while you get back on your feet. Additionally, some banks offer hardship programs that provide assistance for people who can’t afford large and high-interest credit card balances. Bankruptcy should be considered the last option if you have exhausted all other alternatives, added Lupo. If your budget doesn’t allow you to resume payments, it’s important to start looking for alternatives as soon as possible, recommended Bandebo. “The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

        "headline": "How removing unpaid medical bills from credit reports could help consumers",
        "date": "January 07, 2025",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Lenders will no longer be able to consider unpaid medical bills as a credit history factor when they evaluate potential borrowers in the U.S. for mortgages, car loans or business loans, according to a rule the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau finalized Tuesday. Removing medical debts from consumer credit reports is expected to increase the credit scores of millions of families by an average of 20 points, the bureau said. The CFPB says its research showed that outstanding health care claims are a poor predictor of someone’s ability to repay a loan yet often are used to deny mortgage applications . The three national credit reporting agencies — Experian, Equifax and TransUnion — said last year that they were removing medical collections under $500 from U.S. consumer credit reports. The government agency’s new rule goes further by banning all outstanding medical bills from appearing on credit reports and prohibiting lenders from using the information. The rule is set to take effect 60 days after publication in the Federal Register, although President-elect Donald Trump has proposed sweeping changes and limits to the CFPB’s regulatory reach. Here’s what to know:  The CFPB estimates the rule will remove $49 million in medical debt from the credit reports of 15 million Americans. According to the agency, one in five Americans have at least one medical debt collection account on their credit reports, and over half of collection entries on credit reports are for medical debts. The problem disproportionately affects people of color, the CFPB has found: 28% of Black people and 22% of Latino people in the U.S. carry medical debt versus 17% of white people. While the national credit reporting agencies voluntarily agreed to disregard medical debt below $500, many consumers have amounts much higher than this threshold on their reports. The CFPB says its action will give millions of consumers increased access to loans and lead to the approval of approximately 22,000 additional mortgages a year. Americans with outstanding medical bills may see their credit scores rise by an average of 20 points, according to the bureau. The rule was also drafted to increase privacy protections and to help keep debt collectors from using the credit reporting system to coerce people into paying bills they don’t owe. The CFPB has found that consumers frequently receive inaccurate bills or are asked to pay bills that should have been covered by insurance or financial assistance programs. What’s more, lenders will be barred from using information about medical devices, such as prosthetic limbs, to make them serve as collateral for a loan and subject to repossession, according to the CFPB’s announcement. Nonprofits in the healthcare space are pleased. “This decision is great news for everyday Americans,” said Carrie Joy Grimes, founder of personal finance organization WorkMoney. “Medical debt is not a reflection of being bad with money — any one of us can experience illness or injury. With this new rule, Americans will now be able to focus less on the strain of medical debt and more on getting back on their feet.” Patricia Kelmar, health care campaigns director for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, said the rule would help “many financially responsible families who have accumulated medical debt from unpredictable health issues, high out-of-pocket costs, insurance claim denials and billing errors.” While high medical bills are common in the US , including for individuals and households with insurance, there are ways to get relief. First, determine whether you qualify for charity care. Federal law requires nonprofit hospitals to lower or write off bills for individuals depending on household income. To determine if you qualify, do an internet search for the hospital or health care provider along with the phrase “charity care” or “financial assistance policy.” The nonprofit organization Dollar For also provides a simplified online tool for patients. Next, appeal under the provisions of the No Surprises Act, a federal law that says insurance companies must reasonably cover any out-of-network services related to emergency and some non-emergency medical care. If you’re being charged more than you’re used to or expect when you receive in-network services, that bill may be illegal. Also: Always ask for an itemized bill. Medical billing is notoriously complicated and rife with errors. An itemized bill includes the billing codes of all care received. If something is off between these codes and the care provided, contesting your bill can yield changes. Another approach — comparing the bill with insurance companies’ estimates of fair charges for services can also help. If the price you were charged is more than average, you may have your costs lowered. You could even take the provider to small claims court over the discrepancy - or let them know you have a case. Finally, always compare your insurance company’s “explanation of benefits” to the bill. The hospital’s bill must match the explanation of costs that are covered and not covered. If it does not, you have another reason not to pay and to ask the provider to work with your insurance company further first. Even after taking these steps, you can always appeal health claims with your insurance company if you believe there is any reason the bills should be covered entirely or more than the company initially decided. You may also contact your state insurance commissioner for support.

        "date": "December 27, 2024",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — With the end of 2024 around the corner, you might be reflecting on financial goals for 2025. Whether you’re saving to move out of your parents’ house or pay off student loan debt, financial resolutions can help you stay motivated, said Courtney Alev, consumer advocate for Credit Karma. “Entering a new year doesn’t erase all our financial challenges from the prior year,” Alev said. “But it can really help to bring a fresh-start mentality to how you’re managing your finances.” If you’re planning to make financial resolutions for the new year, experts recommend that you start by evaluating the state of your finances in 2024. Then, set specific goals and make sure they’re attainable for your lifestyle. Here are some tips from experts: Think about how you currently deal with finances — what’s good, what’s bad, and what can improve. “Let this be the year you change your relationship with money,” said Ashley Lapato, personal finance educator for YNAB, a budgeting app. If you feel like money is a chore, that there’s shame surrounding the topic of money, or like you were born being “bad at money,” it’s time to change that mentality, Lapato said. To adjust your approach, Lapato recommends viewing money goals as an opportunity to imagine your desired lifestyle in the future. She recommends asking questions like, “What do my 30s look like? What do my 40s look like?” and using money as a means to get there. Liz Young Thomas, head of SoFi Investment Strategy, added that it’s key you forgive yourself for past mistakes in order to move into the new year with motivation.  When setting your financial resolutions for 2025, it’s important to establish the “why” of each, said Matt Watson, CEO of Origin, a financial tracking app. “If you can attach the financial goal to a bigger life goal, it’s much more motivating and more likely you’ll continue on that path,” Watson said. Whether you’re saving to buy a house, pay off credit card debt or take a summer vacation, being clear about the goal can keep you motivated. Watson also recommends using a tool to help you keep track of your finances, such as an app, spreadsheet, or website. “After three years of inflation, your pay increases are likely still playing catch up to your monthly expenses, leaving you wondering where all the money is going,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. “Make that monthly budget for 2025 and resolve to track your spending against it throughout the year.” McBride said that you may need to make adjustments during the year as certain expenses increase, which would require cutting back in other areas. “Calibrate your spending with your income, and any month you spend less than budgeted, transfer the difference into your savings account, ideally a high-yield savings account,” he said. “Interest rates aren’t likely to come down very fast, so you’re still going to have to put in the hard work of paying down debt, especially high-cost credit card debt, and do so with urgency,” McBride said. Start by taking stock of how much debt you have now relative to the beginning of the year. Hopefully you’ve made steady progress on paying it down, but, if you’ve gone in the other direction, McBride encourages making a game plan. That includes looking into 0% balance transfer offers. “You have more power over credit card interest rates than you think you do,” said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree. “Wielding that power is one of the best moves you can make in 2025.” A 0% balance transfer credit card is “a good weapon” in the fight against high card APRs, or annual percentage rates, he said. A low-interest personal loan is an option as well. You may simply be able to pick up the phone and ask for a lower interest rate. LendingTree found that a majority of people who did that in 2024 were successful, and the average reduction was more than 6 points. When planning for your financial resolutions, it’s important to consider how you’re going to make your goals sustainable for your lifestyle, said Credit Karma’s Alev. “It really is a marathon, not a sprint,” Alev said. Alev recommends setting realistic, practical goals to make it easier to stick with them. For example, instead of planning to save thousands of dollars by the end of the year, start by saving $20 a paycheck. Even when your plans are achievable, there are times you’ll get derailed. Maybe it’s an unexpected medical bill or an extraordinary life event. When these situations happen, Alev recommends trying not to feel defeated and working to get back on track without feeling guilty. “You can’t manage what you can’t see, so set a New Year’s resolution to check your credit score monthly in 2025,” said Rikard Bandebo, chief economist at VantageScore. “Be sure to pay more than the minimum on your credit accounts, as that’s one of the best ways to boost your credit score.” Bandebo also advises student loan borrowers to make all payments on time, as servicers will begin to report late payments starting in January, and missed payments will affect borrowers’ credit scores. Automated changes, like increasing workplace 401(k) plan contributions, setting up direct deposits from paychecks into dedicated savings accounts, and arranging for monthly transfers into an IRA and/or 529 college savings accounts all add up quickly, McBride said. Your financial goals can encompass more than just managing your money better — they can also be about keeping your money safe from scams . A golden rule to protect yourself from scams is to “slow down,” said Johan Gerber, executive vice president of security solutions at Mastercard. “You have to slow down and talk to other people if you’re not sure (whether or not) it’s scam,” said Gerber, who recommends building an accountability system with family to keep yourself and your loved ones secure. Scammers use urgency to make people fall for their tricks, so taking your time to make any financial decision can keep you from losing money. Your financial goals don’t always have to be rooted in a dollar amount — they can also be about well-being. Finances are deeply connected with our mental health, and, to take care of our money, we also need to take care of ourselves. “I think that now more than any other year, your financial wellness should be a resolution,” said Alejandra Rojas, personal finance expert and founder of The Money Mindset Hub, a mentoring platform for women entrepreneurs. “Your mental health with money should be a resolution.” To focus on your financial wellness, you can set one or two goals focusing on your relationship with money. For example, you could find ways to address and resolve financial trauma, or you could set a goal to talk more openly with loved ones about money, Rojas said. —— The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

        "headline": "The Fed expects to cut rates more slowly in 2025. What that could mean for mortgages, debt and more",
        "date": "December 19, 2024",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — The Federal Reserve’s third interest rate cut of the year will likely have consequences for debt, savings, auto loans, mortgages and other forms of borrowing by consumers and businesses. But with inflation pressures still elevated and with concern that President-elect Donald Trump’s policies could fuel inflation, the Fed indicated Wednesday that it’s likely to cut rates more gradually in 2025 than it had projected three months ago. The policymakers now envision two rate cuts next year, not the four they predicted back in September. The result is that borrowers who have been hoping for much-lower-rate loans could be disappointed. Loan rates may barely budge if the Fed sticks with its plan to cut its key short-term rate only twice next year. “This could be the last cut for a while,” said Jacob Channel, senior economist for LendingTree. “Because the upcoming Trump administration’s policies might cause a resurgence in inflation or otherwise throw the economy off balance, the Fed might choose to take a wait-and-see approach and hold rates steady at their January meeting.” Depending on the specific proposals the Trump administration manages to enact, the Fed could hold off on any additional cuts until March or even later. Here’s what to know: “Another rate cut is welcome news at the end of a chaotic year, but it ultimately doesn’t amount to much for those with debt,” said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree. “A quarter-point reduction may knock a dollar or two off your monthly debt payment. It certainly doesn’t change the fact that the best thing cardholders can do in 2025 is to take matters into their own hands when it comes to high interest rates.” The average annual percentage rate on a new credit card offer, according to LendingTree, is 24.43%. In September, it was 24.92%. Further modest declines in that rate, Schulz said, are possible in the next few months. But, he cautioned, “Anyone expecting card rates to go from awful to amazing overnight because of the Fed is going to be sorely disappointed.” Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, said that particularly for credit card users who carry debt from month to month, “It’s a drop in the bucket for anyone feeling pressure from high rates.” For savers, returns on high-yield accounts have dropped, too, in tandem with the Fed’s rate cuts. So while these accounts are not quite as attractive as they had been, they might still be worth investigating if you haven’t shopped for one recently. Some of these accounts offer yields at or near 5%. “Yes, you’ve missed the peak rates seen a few months ago,” Schulz said. “But even at these levels, they’re still likely higher than what you’ll find at a traditional bank.” Though the Fed doesn’t set mortgage rates, it does influence them. Long-term mortgage rates generally track the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which, in turn, is driven in part by the market’s outlook for inflation and the Fed’s benchmark rate. That means that, at least indirectly, cuts to the Fed’s key rate can put downward pressure on mortgage rates, even if they don’t move in lockstep. “Case in point, turmoil in the bond market has caused mortgage rates to yo-yo up and down over the last month,” Channel said. “After peaking at 6.84% for the week ending Nov. 21, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has since come down to 6.60%.” Despite this decline, this average remains well above the 2024 low of 6.08%, back in late September. For people with fixed mortgages, their rate won’t change unless they refinance their mortgage or sell and move someplace else. The effects of the Fed’s half-point rate cut in September and its quarter-point cut in November have largely been passed through to auto loans, which fell on average from a peak of 7.3% in July to 6.8% last month, said Ivan Drury, director of insights for Edmunds.com. The half-point drop, he said, has helped more people afford new vehicles, helping to spur a buying spree in November. But the increased demand, which Drury attributed largely to some optimism over Trump’s election, also boosted average prices and monthly payments to record levels. “Optimism and having money on hand to do these things has definitely green-lit some people’s spending, when other folks are more conservative with how much they’re spending,” he said. The average amount that a car buyer financed rose to $42,160, and average monthly payments hit $753, according to Edmunds data. Edmunds expects only a modest increase in auto sales next year, from just under 16 million vehicles this year to 16.2 million in 2025. “The Federal Open Market Committee is in a balancing act — cut (rates) too much and risk inflation resurgence; cut too little and continue to squeeze the labor market,” said Renter of NerdWallet. Gregory Daco, chief economist for EY, suggested that Fed Chair Jerome Powell is reiterating “the familiar metaphor of moving slowly in a dark room full of objects to justify a potential rate cut ‘skip’ at the January meeting.” “This will favor a gradual easing of policy to observe how the economy and inflation behave, indicating an extremely ‘data-dependent’ approach,” Daco said. “Remember,” Channel said, “the Fed is designed to pivot relatively quickly should something unexpected happen. If the economy shows serious signs of deterioration, we could see bigger and more frequent cuts over the next 12 months.” On the other hand, he cautioned, “if inflation rears its head and spikes once more, (rate) cuts might be moved off the table.” AP Auto Writer Tom Krisher contributed to this report from Detroit.

        "headline": "How to avoid financial stress during the holiday season",
        "date": "December 18, 2024",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — The holidays are meant to be a time of celebration with family and friends. But they can also bring pressure to spend money on gifts, gatherings and plane tickets home, exacerbated by brand emails , social media influencers and family expectations. With credit card debt rising and prices for many items still high due to inflation , overspending during the holiday season can add to the financial stress many Americans are already experiencing, said Dr. Marketa Wills, CEO and medical director of the American Psychiatric Association. “The idea that one is on the hook for buying gifts for all their friends and families adds an enormous amount of stress on someone trying to have a perfect holiday,” Wills said. But there are ways to get through the holidays without spending more than you can afford. From setting expectations with your family to making a budget to gifting experiences rather than things, here are expert recommendations to avoid financial stress this holiday season: To avoid overspending on gifts for family and friends, set a specific goal, said Matt Watson, CEO of Origin, a financial planning app. Ask yourself what your spending limit is before you start shopping. AP correspondent Haya Panjwani reports on spending during the holidays. “People get into ‘justification mode’ where you have a general sense of what you want to spend but then you see this really nice thing and all of the sudden you’ve done that a few times and you spend twice as much as you thought you might,” Watson said. Watson also recommends that you include in your budget calculations how much you’ll pay for taxes and shipping.  In many families, the holidays mean going all out with gift-giving. But this can quickly become stressful if your finances make it hard to keep up. Managing expectations is key. “You can avoid feeling inadequate, or like you’re not doing a good job, by having an honest conversation about where your finances are,” Watson said. Being open about your money can be difficult, but sharing if you are struggling with debt or other financial issues can help family and friends understand that they should prioritize low-cost gifts or activities. Planning your holiday shopping ahead of time can make it easier to stick to your budget,. “When people feel rushed, oftentimes they’re going to buy more expensive things,” said Watson, who also pointed out that shipping costs increase closer to Christmas. As you budget for the holidays, make a list of the items you want to purchase and slowly start buying them. This way, you divide your costs among several paychecks and avoid relying on credit for last-minute expenses. Wills recommends that people opt for homemade gifts if they want to show appreciation for their loved ones without overspending. Homemade gifts don’t always have to be crafts, they can also be actions. “I will do babysitting for you, I will cook a meal for you,” Wills said. “Those kinds of things take a financial pressure off and make for a more joyous holiday season.” In recent years, shopping expert Trae Bodge has noticed that younger people prefer to gift each other experiences rather than items. She recommends finding affordable, fun activities to do with your loved ones. Examples include going ice skating, hiking or hosting a potluck. You could also gift a photoshoot or framed pictures or digital albums to commemorate happy experiences. Expectations or traditions you grew up with, such as buying expensive gifts for every member of your extended family, can cause stress during the holidays. This is what Bodge refers as “keeping up with the Joneses,” which refers to trying to keep up with the expectations of other people rather than what is realistic for you to spend. “Sometimes you may have a family member that is very financially well-off and they love to treat you to big, extravagant things. If you’re not in that same financial position, you should not feel compelled to return the favor,” Bodge said. When creating your own new traditions, Watson recommends sharing the financial goals you have, such as saving for a house or paying off debt. This will help your loved ones understand why you’re looking to limit expenses during the holidays. Wills also recommends cutting costs by being selective with your expenses. For example, when it comes to hosting, even having a small group of people can be very expensive if you’re expected to pay for everything. If you’re in this situation, you could propose that everyone brings a dish. “Think about having a potluck meal for the holiday. Have everybody bring something to the event to help share the cost,” she said. If you are having financial difficulties, it can help to talk about it with your family and friends. “Sharing about stress can in and of itself be therapeutic for the individual who may be having concerns for that during the during the holiday season,” Wills said. Making room to listen to your loved ones’ feelings is equally important, she said. And if the holidays are a tough time for you, Wills recommended that you prioritize your mental health and good habits such as resting well and exercising. It’s the season where social events are happening every weekend but if they are causing you too much financial stress or hurting your mental health, it’s okay to be selective. Additionally, if you start feeling uncomfortable about certain conversations with your family, Wills recommends you take some time for yourself by taking a walk or removing yourself from the conversation. If you are experiencing mental health struggles, there are several resources you can use to find professional help. In the U.S., you can dial 211 to speak with a mental health expert, confidentially and for free. Other mental health resources include: Veterans Crisis Line: call 1-800-273-TALK (8255) Crisis Text Line: Text the word ‘Home’ to 741-741 The Trevor Lifeline for LGBTQ Youth: 1-866-488-7386 The Trans Lifeline: 1-877-565-8860 The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

        "headline": "The White House is cracking down on overdraft fees",
        "date": "December 12, 2024",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — The Biden administration has finalized a rule limiting overdraft fees banks can charge, as part of the White House’s campaign to reduce junk fees that hit consumers on everyday purchases, including banking services. President Joe Biden had called the fees, which can be as high as $35, “exploitative,” while the banking industry has lobbied extensively to keep the existing fee structures in place. Under the finalized rule announced Thursday, banks will be able to choose from three options: they may charge a flat overdraft fee of $5, they may charge a fee that covers their costs and losses, or they may charge any fee so long as they disclose the terms of the overdraft loan the way they would for any other loan, typically expressed as an annual percentage rate, or APR. While banks have cut back on overdraft fees in the past decade, the nation’s biggest banks still take in roughly $8 billion in the charges every year, according to data from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and bank public records. Currently, there is no cap on the overdraft fees that banks can legally charge. Right now, when a bank temporarily lends a consumer money when their account has reached a zero balance, the consumer is typically responsible for paying back both the overdrawn amount and an additional fee, which can be more than the original amount charged. In one example often cited by opponents of the fees, a $3 cup of coffee can end up costing someone more than $30. The finalized rule is set to take effect in October 2025, but the incoming Trump administration has yet to tap anyone to lead the CFPB, and has mentioned the idea of eliminating the agency.  The finalized rule applies to banks and credit unions that have more than $10 billion in assets, which includes the nation’s largest banks. Banks have previously sued the CFPB over these rules and caps on credit card late fees, and are likely to sue again. Congress also has the ability to challenge or overturn the rule. Overdraft fees originated during a time when consumers wrote and cashed checks more frequently — so that the checks would clear instead of bouncing, if there was an issue of timing — but banks steadily increased the fees in the first two decades of the 2000s. The fees disproportionately affect banks’ most cash-strapped consumers. A majority of overdrafts (70%) are charged to customers with average account balances between $237 and $439, according to the CFPB. The agency estimates the new rule would save consumers about $5 billion in annual overdraft fees, or $225 per household that typically experiences the fees.

        "headline": "USDA bans school lunch fees for low-income families",
        "date": "November 05, 2024",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that students eligible for free or reduced price school meals cannot be charged processing fees beginning in 2027. School districts currently work with processing companies to offer cashless payment systems for families. But the companies can charge “processing fees” for each transaction. By law, students who are eligible for reduced price meals cannot be charged more than 30 cents for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch. With processing fees, however, families can end up paying 10 times that amount. Processing companies charge as much as $3.25 or 4% to 5% per transaction, according to a recent report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. For families with lower incomes who can’t afford to load large sums in one go, processing fees can arrive weekly or even more frequently, increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to the report. The new Agriculture Department’s policy becomes effective starting in the 2027-2028 school year. With this rule, the USDA will lower costs for families with income under 185% of federal poverty guidelines, which equals $57,720 for a family of four. “USDA and schools across America share the common goal of nourishing schoolchildren and giving them the fuel they need to learn, grow and thrive,” said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement Friday. “While today’s action to eliminate extra fees for lower-income households is a major step in the right direction, the most equitable path forward is to offer every child access to healthy school meals at no cost. We will continue to work with Congress to move toward that goal so all kids have the nutrition they need to reach their full potential.”  The decision by the USDA follows a CFPB report that found online school meal payments predominantly affect low-income families. School lunch fees collectively cost families upwards of $100 million each year, according to the report. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has mandated that school districts inform families of their options since 2017, but even when parents are aware, having to pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome. “It’s just massively inconvenient,” said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two school-aged children. Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the $3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch account transactions, she and her husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead. “A dollar here and there, I expected,” she said. “But $3.25 per transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of living is a lot lower — as are the salaries — is a lot.” Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day became a burden in both time and effort for two working parents. For the past two years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free school lunches which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at any point. In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S., the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37 or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a child’s account. While payment companies maintain that school districts can negotiate fees and rates before they agree to contracts, the CFPB found that complex company structures “may insulate companies from competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate.” Just three companies — MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe, and LINQ Connect — dominate the market, according to the report. Without the ability to choose which company to work with, “families have fewer ways to avoid harmful practices,” the agency said, “including those that may violate federal consumer protection law.” “The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

        "headline": "How to protect yourself from scammers offering fake jobs",
        "date": "October 28, 2024",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Between finding openings, sending out your resume and interviewing, looking for a job is tough. Now a growing trend of scammers impersonating recruiters is making it even harder. In the last year, job scams have been on the rise, according to Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit that helps consumers when their identities are compromised. Because most job seekers turn to online platforms for employment, scammers impersonate companies and recruiters to trick people into giving them money or personal information. “We’ve really seen tremendous growth in job scams,” Velasquez said. “I think that’s just due to the fact that we fundamentally changed the way we recruit and hire people.” It happened to Tehseen Islam, a 28-year-old quality assurance analyst. She had been looking for a job for a few months when she finally got an offer from a well-known marketing technology company. Or at least she thought she did. After a weeklong process that included an online form with interview screening questions, Islam was offered the job and received a check. She was asked to deposit it and send the company $1,000 to pay for shipment of equipment she’d need for the job. A few days later, her bank notified her that the check had bounced and, because it looked like she was cooperating with scammers, it was ending all banking relationships with her. That’s when she learned the job was a scam.  “I’m a little traumatized,” said Islam, who lost the $1,000 and unknowingly shared personal information with scammers. If you’re a job seeker, here are some recommendations from experts on how to avoid job scammers: Job scams are a type of impersonation scam . Scammers tend to use the name of an employee from a large company and craft a job posting that matches similar positions. An initial red flag is that scammers usually try to make the job very appealing, Velasquez said. “They’re going to have very high salaries for somewhat low-skilled work,” she said. “And they’re often saying it’s a 100% remote position because that’s so appealing to people.” Some scammers post fake jobs, but others reach out directly to job seekers through direct messages or texts. If the scammers are looking to steal your personal information, they may ask you to fill out several forms that include information like your Social Security number and driver’s license details. The only information a legitimate employer should ask for at the beginning of the process is your skills, your work experience, and your contact information, Velasquez said. Other details don’t generally need to be shared with an employer until after you’ve gotten an offer. Whether you’re replying to a job posting or a recruiter, you must research the company, especially if you didn’t initiate the conversation, Velasquez said. Fake recruiters often contact job seekers through social media or text messages. If someone reaches out to you, verify their identity before responding to their message. Here are a few recommendations while you research the recruiter or the company: — Don’t respond to the message right away. — Go online and research if the company has current job openings on its official website. — Research the name of the recruiter and check if the person has a verifiable social media presence. — If the company has a job opening on its website, apply directly through the website. If you receive a message from a recruiter, it’s best to not respond unless you know that the source is reputable. Avoid clicking on any links sent to you, whether to apply for a position or to fill out a questionnaire. In Islam’s case, the scammers sent her a form with interview screening questions where they asked for her personal information. A common tactic is for scammers to send you a fake signing bonus and then ask you to send some money back, supposedly to cover expenses. This is a way for scammers to steal money from job seekers, said Alvaro Puig, consumer education specialist at the Federal Trade Commission. “If you deposit a check and it’s fake, your account will show the money is there. But then days later, the bank will discover that it was a fake check,” Puig said. So, if you take out money from your account and send it to the fake recruiter, the money will be coming from your bank account and it will be impossible to get back. When job hunting through platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed, Velasquez recommends being very cautious with job openings and recruiters you trust. While these platforms are reputable and many of their job postings are real, the companies cannot verify every single employment opportunity posted. This creates an opportunity for scammers to post fake job listings and trick people. “Don’t let platforms that you know are legitimate allow other people to borrow that trust,” Velasquez said. After her experience with job scammers, Islam has been more careful with the job openings she trusts. Now, she has a list of steps she follows, including verifying a recruiter’s email through a free email address validator, such as Emailable or Clearout, and calling the company directly. “This is adding a lot more time to my job search now but I can’t just blindly trust that this person is who they say they are,” Islam said. If you or a family member is a victim of a scam, it’s good practice to report it on the FTC’s website .

        "date": "October 19, 2024",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — October is Cybersecurity Awareness Month, which means it’s the perfect time to learn how to protect yourself from scams. “Scams have become so sophisticated now. Phishing emails, texts, spoofing caller ID, all of this technology gives scammers that edge,” said Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center. As scammers find new ways to steal money and personal information, consumers should be more vigilant about who they trust, especially online. A quick way to remember what to do when you think you’re getting scammed is to think about the three S’s, said Alissa Abdullah, also known as Dr. Jay, Mastercard’s deputy chief security officer “Stay suspicious, stop for a second (and think about it) and stay protected,” she said. Whether it’s romance scams or job scams, impersonators are looking for ways to trick you into giving them money or sharing your personal information. Here’s what to know: Three common tactics used by scammers are based on fear, urgency and money, said security expert Petros Efstathopoulos. Here’s how they work: — Fear When a scammer contacts you via phone or email, they use language that makes it seem like there is a problem that you need to solve. For example, a scammer contacts you over email telling you that your tax return has an error and if you don’t fix it you’ll get in trouble. — Urgency Because scammers are good at creating a sense of urgency, people tend to rush, which makes them vulnerable. Scammers often tell people they need to act right away, which can lead to them sharing private information such as their Social Security numbers.  — Money Scammers use money as bait, Efstathopoulos said. They might impersonate tax professionals or the IRS saying you will get a bigger tax refund than you expect if you pay them for their services or share your personal information. Simply being aware of typical scams can help, experts say. Robocalls in particular frequently target vulnerable individuals like seniors, people with disabilities, and people with debt. “If you get a robocall out of the blue paying a recorded message trying to get you to buy something, just hang up,” said James Lee, chief operating officer at the Identity Theft Resource Center. “Same goes for texts — anytime you get them from a number you don’t know asking you to pay, wire, or click on something suspicious.” Lee urges consumers to hang up and call the company or institution in question at an official number. Scammers will also often imitate someone in authority, such as a tax or debt collector. They might pretend to be a loved one calling to request immediate financial assistance for bail, legal help, or a hospital bill. So-called “romance scams” often target lonely and isolated individuals, according to Will Maxson, assistant director of the Division of Marketing Practices at the FTC. These scams can take place over longer periods of time -- even years. Kate Kleinart, 70, who lost tens of thousands to a romance scam over several months, said to be vigilant if a new Facebook friend is exceptionally good-looking, asks you to download WhatsApp to communicate, attempts to isolate you from friends and family, and/or gets romantic very quickly. “If you’re seeing that picture of a very handsome person, ask someone younger in your life — a child, a grandchild, a niece or a nephew — to help you reverse-image search or identify the photo,” she said. She said the man in pictures she received was a plastic surgeon from Spain whose photos have been stolen and used by scammers. Kleinart had also been living under lockdown during the early pandemic when she got the initial friend request, and the companionship and communication meant a lot to her while she was cut off from family. When the scam fell apart, she missed the relationship even more than the savings. “Losing the love was worse than losing the money,” she said. Job scams involve a person pretending to be a recruiter or a company in order to steal money or information from a job seeker. Scammers tend to use the name of an employee from a large company and craft a job posting that matches similar positions. An initial red flag is that scammers usually try to make the job very appealing, Velasquez said. “They’re going to have very high salaries for somewhat low-skilled work,” she said. “And they’re often saying it’s a 100% remote position because that’s so appealing to people.” Some scammers post fake jobs, but others reach out directly to job seekers through direct messages or texts.

The only information a legitimate employer should ask for at the beginning of the process is your skills, your work experience, and your contact information, Velasquez said. Other details don’t generally need to be shared with an employer until after you’ve gotten an offer. According to Lois Greisman, an associate director of marketing practices at the Federal Trade Commission, an investment scam constitutes any get-rich-quick scheme that lures targets via social media accounts or online ads. Investment scammers typically add different forms of “testimony,” such as from other social media accounts, to support that the “investment” works. Many of these also involve cryptocurrency. To avoid falling for these frauds, the FTC recommends independently researching the company — especially by searching the company’s name along with terms like “review” or “scam.” When you’re using Facebook or scrolling Google results, be aware of quiz scams , which typically appear innocuous and ask about topics you might be interested in, such as your car or favorite TV show. They may also ask you to take a personality test. Despite these benign-seeming questions, scammers can then use the personal information you share to respond to security questions from your accounts or hack your social media to send malware links to your contacts. To protect your personal information, the FTC simply recommends steering clear of online quizzes . The commission also advises consumers to use random answers for security questions. “Asked to enter your mother’s maiden name? Say it’s something else: Parmesan or another word you’ll remember,” advises Terri Miller, consumer education specialist at the FTC. “This way, scammers won’t be able to use information they find to steal your identity.” When buying or selling products on Instagram or Facebook Marketplace, keep in mind that not everyone that reaches out to you has the best intentions. To avoid being scammed when selling via an online platform, the FTC recommends checking buyers’ profiles, not sharing any codes sent to your phone or email, and avoiding accepting online payments from unknown persons. Likewise, when buying something from an online marketplace , make sure to diligently research the seller. Take a look at whether the profile is verified, what kind of reviews they have, and the terms and conditions of the purchase. Scammers often reach out by phone, Ben Hoffman, Head of Strategy and Consumer Products at Fifth Third Bank recommends that you don’t pick up unknown incoming calls. “Banks don’t ask your for your password,” said Hoffman. If you believe your bank is trying to reach out, give them a call at a number listed on their website. This makes it easier to know for sure that you’re not talking to a scammer. As a general rule, banks don’t often call unless there is suspicious activity on your account or if you previously contacted them about a problem. If you receive many unknown calls that end up being scammers or robocalls, you can use tools available on your phone to block spam. Check here for how to do this on your iPhone and here for Android . There are many tools are your disposal that can be used to protect yourself from scammers online. — Use a password manager to ensure you’re utilizing a complex password that scammers can’t guess. — Regularly checking your credit report and bank statements is a good practice since it can help you identify if someone has been using your bank account without your knowledge. — Turn on multi-factor verification to make sure impersonators aren’t able to access your social media or bank accounts. As scams get more sophisticated, it’s difficult to know who to trust or if a person is actually real, or an impersonator. If you aren’t sure if a job recruiter is real or if your bank is actually asking your for information, find organizations that can help you, recommended Velasquez. Organizations like the Identity Theft Protection Center and the AARP Fraud Watch Network offer free services for customers who need help identifying scams or knowing what to do if you’ve been a victim of a scam. If you’ve taken all the necessary steps to protect yourself, you might want to help those around you. Whether you’re helping your grandparents to block unknown callers on their phones or sharing tips with your neighbors, talking with others about how to protect themselves from scams can be very effective. If you or a family member is a victim of a scam, it’s good practice to report it on the FTC’s website .

        "headline": "Why you shouldn’t store your money in payment apps",
        "date": "October 16, 2024",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Connor Tomasko grew up wary of credit cards. As she taught herself more about managing money, she realized that many people also have bad habits when it comes to payment apps. Tomasko, 31, a freelance software consultant in Chicago, understands why people appreciate the ease of the apps, which typically only require you to know someone’s username in order to send money. But she realized that keeping money in the apps could be risky and means losing out on the interest from a high yield savings account. She now immediately transfers any payments out of the apps and encourages friends to do the same. “I’m definitely the one that is always harping about high yield savings accounts,” Tomasko said. “But if you’re in an industry dealing with a lot of cash — bartending, say — sometimes you’re just worried about finding a place to deposit it. It’s not always a fun thing to talk about.” As use of payment apps has grown in recent years, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has issued guidance on best practices to avoid pitfalls. For example, funds stored on Venmo or Cash App typically lack the deposit insurance you’d get from a bank, except in certain cases. “Popular digital payment apps are increasingly used as substitutes for a traditional bank or credit union account, but lack the same protections to ensure that funds are safe,” CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a bulletin last year.  In 2022, transaction volume on these apps was an estimated $893 billion, according to the CFPB, and that’s projected to reach $1.6 trillion by 2027. More than three-quarters of US adults say they have ever used one of four popular payment apps, according to a 2022 survey from the Pew Research Center . Of consumers ages 18 to 29, 85% said they’ve used a service such as PayPal, Venmo, Apple Cash, Google Pay, or Zelle, according to a March 2022 study by Consumer Reports . “The apps are popular because you don’t have to give your personal information, like a phone number, if you just got drinks with someone once but you’re never going to see them again — a date that didn’t go well,” Tomasko said. “I get the benefits in that sense — to be able to send money that way.” Here’s what you should know: “It may be tempting to leave money sitting in peer-to-peer lending accounts so that you’re ready to pay your friends when they request money to cover your portion of a dinner bill... (but) there are a few reasons why we wouldn’t suggest doing that,” said Courtney Alev, consumer advocate at Credit Karma. Funds stored in payment apps often lack deposit insurance, the CFPB has found. FDIC-insured banks protect depositors against the loss of their insured deposits up to at least $250,000 if a bank fails, and a similar framework protects credit unions. While funds stored on payment apps resemble funds stored on deposit accounts, those funds are not typically covered until they have been transferred back to an FDIC-insured bank or insured credit union. The Financial Technology Association, an industry group that includes many payment apps as members, noted that Cash App and PayPal both offer separate high-yield, FDIC-insured savings products. In select circumstances, deposit insurance does cover payment apps. With Cash App, funds are eligible for insurance if consumers link their account to a Cash App debit card. And with Venmo, funds added to an account via direct deposit or check cashing are covered. Still, the CFPB has found that funds stored in a payment app “may be at significantly higher risk of loss for a consumer than if it is deposited in an insured bank or credit union account.” “Consumers should be aware of these risks if they choose to leave a balance on these nonbank payment apps,” the agency wrote in its report last year. To minimize risks, the CFPB said consumers should “transfer their balances back” to federally insured accounts. Some payment app companies are able to invest users’ funds in loans and bonds, earning money on the investments while generally paying no interest on users’ balances, the CFPB found. To maximize your own funds, immediately transfer any deposits to an account where you can collect interest. “Leaving money sitting in those accounts is leaving potential interest from a high-yield savings account on the table,” said Alev. “All of that interest adds up over time, so your money could be growing elsewhere.” Tomasko said she always uses the ‘1-3 business day’ option to transfer funds when using Venmo, to avoid incurring fees, while Cash App has a setting that users can select to automatically route money back to their bank accounts, which she uses. “There’s definitely room for improvement in the space,” she said. “With Venmo, every time I receive a payment, I go in to actively transfer it out.” The Financial Technology Association said in a statement that “tens of millions of Americans use payment apps every day to send money to friends and family, cover routine expenses, and manage their finances.” “Consumers choose these apps because they are safe, convenient, and transparent,” said FTA CEO and President Penny Lee. This story has been updated to correct the name of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the name of Apple’s peer-to-peer payment app. The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

        "date": "October 10, 2024",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Tens of millions of older Americans will see an increase in benefits this January when a new cost-of-living adjustment is added to Social Security payments. The 2.5% raise is intended to help meet higher prices for food, fuel, and other goods and services. The average recipient will see an increase of about $50 per month, according to agency officials. Social Security recipients received a 3.2% increase in their benefits in 2024, and some retirees are concerned that this year’s increase is not big enough to meet their needs. The Social Security Administration will begin notifying recipients about their new benefit amount by mail starting in early December. Adjusted payments to nearly 7.5 million people receiving Supplemental Security Income will begin on December 31. Supplemental Security Income provides monthly payments to adults and children who have income below specific financial limits and qualify to receive Social Security benefits. Here’s what to keep in mind: About 72.5 million people, including retirees, disabled people and children, get Social Security benefits. The program is funded by taxes on income subject to Social Security payroll taxes. The government uses taxes from working people to pay benefits to people who have already retired, people who are disabled, the survivors of workers who have died, and dependents of beneficiaries . In 2025, the Social Security payroll tax will be assessed on the first $176,100 of income, up from $168,600 this year This story is featured in our One Notable Number series , which spotlights the key numbers leading our coverage. Take a look at more Notable Numbers here. You can also read more ONEs: While the money is used to pay people currently receiving benefits, any unused money goes to the Social Security trust fund. Some of the money in the trust, together with the Social Security contributions of people in the workforce, pays for future benefits. To determine what amount of Social Security you’ll receive, the government calculates a percentage of your highest wages from your top 35 years of earning, factoring in when you choose to start receiving benefits. The COLA is calculated according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index, but there are calls to use a different index — one that measures price changes based on the spending patterns of the elderly — like healthcare, food and medicine costs. The smaller increase for 2025 is because inflation is slowing. That means prices aren’t increasing as fast as they were at the height of the COVID pandemic. Recipients got a historically large 8.7% benefit increase in 2023 because of record high inflation . Future problems with the fund have long been predicted, largely because of demographic shifts. As birthrates decline, fewer people become workers, which results in fewer payments of payroll taxes. Meanwhile, more Baby Boomers are retiring and collecting Social Security. The annual Social Security and Medicare trustees report released in May said the program’s trust fund will be unable to pay full benefits beginning in 2035. If the trust fund is depleted, the government will be able to pay only 83% of scheduled benefits, the report said.

        "headline": "The grace period for student loan payments is over. Here’s what you need to know",
        "date": "October 01, 2024",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — The 12-month grace period for student loan borrowers ended on Sept. 30. The “on-ramp” period helped borrowers who are struggling to make payments avoid the risk of defaulting and hurting their credit score. “The end of the on-ramp period means the beginning of the potentially harsh consequences for student loan borrowers who are not able to make payments,” said Persis Yu, Deputy Executive Director at the Student Borrower Protection Center. Around 43 million Americans have student loan debt, amounting to $1.5 trillion. Around eight million of those borrowers had enrolled in the SAVE plan, the newest income-driven repayment plan that extended the eligibility for borrowers to have affordable monthly student loan payments. However, this plan is currently on hold due to legal challenges. With the on-ramp period and a separate program known as Fresh Start ending and the SAVE plan on hold, student loan borrowers who are struggling to afford their monthly payments have fewer options, added Yu. Student loan borrowers who haven’t been able to afford their monthly payments must consider their options to avoid going into default. If you have student loans, here’s what you need to know.  The Education Department implemented this grace period to ease the borrower’s transition to make payments after a three-year payment pause during the COVID-19 pandemic. During this year-long period, borrowers were encouraged to keep making payments since interest continued to accumulate. “Normally, loans will default if you fall about nine months behind on making payments, but during this on-ramp period, missed payments would not move people towards defaulting and then being subject to forced collections. However, if you missed payments, you still be falling behind ultimately on repaying your loans,” said Abby Shaforth, director of National Consumer Law Center’s Student Loan Borrower Assistance Project. Since this grace period has ended, student loan borrowers who don’t make payments will go delinquent or, if their loans are not paid for nine months, go into default. Borrowers who cannot afford to make payments can apply for deferment or forbearance, which pause payments, though interest continues to accrue. Borrowers who can’t or don’t pay risk delinquency and eventually default. That can badly hurt your credit rating and make you ineligible for additional aid and government benefits. If a borrower missed one month’s payment, they will start receiving email notifications, said Shaforth. Once the loan hasn’t been paid for three months, loan servicers notify to the credit reporting agencies that the loan is delinquent, affecting your credit history. Once the borrower hasn’t paid the loan for nine months, the loan goes into default. If you’re struggling to pay, advisers first encourage you to check if you qualify for an income-driven repayment plan, which determines your payments by looking at your expenses. You can see whether you qualify by visiting the Federal Student Aid website . If you’ve worked for a government agency or a non-profit organization, you could also be eligible for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program , which forgives student debt after 10 years. When you fall behind on a loan by 270 days — roughly 9 months — the loan appears on your credit report as being in default. Once a loan is in default, it goes into collections. This means the government can garnish wages (without a court order) to go towards paying back the loan, intercept tax refunds, and seize portions of Social Security checks and other benefit payments. If your budget doesn’t allow you to resume payments, it’s important to know how to navigate the possibility of default and delinquency on a student loan. Both can hurt your credit rating, which would make you ineligible for additional aid. If you’re in a short-term financial bind, you may qualify for deferment or forbearance — allowing you to temporarily suspend payment. To determine whether deferment or forbearance are good options for you, you can contact your loan servicer. One thing to note: interest still accrues during deferment or forbearance. Both can also impact potential loan forgiveness options. Depending on the conditions of your deferment or forbearance, it may make sense to continue paying the interest during the payment suspension. The U.S. Education Department offers several plans for repaying federal student loans. Under the standard plan, borrowers are charged a fixed monthly amount that ensures all their debt will be repaid after 10 years. But if borrowers have difficulty paying that amount, they can enroll in one of several plans that offer lower monthly payments based on income and family size. Those are known as income-driven repayment plans. Income-driven options have been offered for years and generally cap monthly payments at 10% of a borrower’s discretionary income. If a borrower’s earnings are low enough, their bill is reduced to $0. And after 20 or 25 years, any remaining debt gets erased. In August, the Supreme Court kept on hold the SAVE plan , the income-driven repayment plan that would have lowered payments for millions of borrowers, while lawsuits make their way through lower courts. Eight million borrowers who had already enrolled in the SAVE plan don’t have to pay their monthly student loan bills until the court case is resolved. Debt that already had been forgiven under the plan was unaffected. The next court hearing about this case will be held on Oct. 15. The Fresh Start program, which gave benefits to borrowers who were delinquent prior to the pandemic payment pause, also closed on Sept. 30. During this limited program, student loan borrowers who were in default prior to the pandemic were given the opportunity to remove their loans from default, allowing them to enroll in income-driven payment plans, or apply for deferment, among other benefits. —— “The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

        "date": "September 23, 2024",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — When Mykail James was 19 and working a holiday job at Victoria’s Secret, she took out a store credit card with a $2,000 credit line. When her school break was over, she realized she could no longer afford the payments. After missing a few, she paid off the card only to find that her credit score had decreased dramatically, affecting her ability to access other types of credit. “I didn’t get an actual bank credit card until I was 21, just because of that fear,” said James, who is now a financial expert and creator of The Boujie Budgeter. “Because of how it impacted my credit and also made it harder for me to buy a car a couple of months later.” With holiday shopping season around the corner, experts recommend caution when your favorite store offers you a credit card. “If you’re offered one at the checkout counter, most of the time it makes sense to say no,” said Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate. According to the Federal Reserve , outstanding credit card balances reached $1.14 trillion as of August 2024, meaning credit card debt is increasingly a concern for millions of Americans. Bankrate found that the average store-only credit card has an average annual percentage rate of 30.45%, significantly higher than the average APR of 20.78% for all credit cards. The APR is how much interest you’ll be charged if you can’t pay your balance in full every month. Here are recommendations from experts when considering a store credit card: AP correspondent Shelley Adler reports on whether signing up for store credit cards is a good thing. This article is part of AP’s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well. Store credit cards are usually offered at checkout, and they provide shoppers with a line of credit that incentivizes spending more on the store’s products. If not managed correctly, these credit cards can negatively impact your credit history. When offered a store credit card, Bruce McClary from the National Foundation for Credit Counseling recommends that you don’t say yes immediately. “Ask for something with all the details in writing that you can take with you and review for a later time,” McClary said. Oftentimes, store credit cards are tied with a promotion such as 0% interest for a year or a discount on your purchase. And while these might sound appealing, it’s best to not rush the decision while you’re at the counter. Before signing up for a store credit card, you must read the fine print, Rossman said, including how much interest will be charged if cards aren’t paid in full and any late or penalty fees. “A lot of times, these retail cards charge tremendously high interest rates,” Rossman said. Another thing to look out for is “deferred interest,” which is when credit cards offer a promotion such as 0% for 12 months but, if the customer doesn’t pay in full by the time the promotion expires, they are charged retroactively for all of the interest that accumulated during that time. If you’re looking to acquire a store credit card, McClary recommends that you do some research on the retailer. Looking at reviews online can help you identify if others have complaints about their store credit cards. Additionally, McClary recommends that you ask yourself these questions: — How often do you shop at the store? — Are you going to be using the card enough to benefit from the rewards and discounts that come with it? — Can you use another type of credit card? — Can you afford to pay the card in full at the end of the month? — How many credit cards do you have? Is it worth adding another line of credit? These questions will help you determine if a store credit card is right for you or if you’d be better off with a different type of credit card. If you decide that a store credit card is a good option, it’s important to pay your card in full each month, McClary said. It’s also a good practice to only spend what you can afford to pay off in one billing cycle, even if your line of credit is higher. “You want to keep yourself from getting into this unmanageable cycle of debt,” McClary said. A tip to build healthy habits is to set specific parameters when using your store credit card, James said. For example, using your store credit card only for purchases over $50. That way you can reduce the amount of money you spend on your credit card and it is easier to keep track of your expenses. Store credit cards were once known as a tool to build your credit history if you’d never had a credit card before. This is because retail credit cards have fewer requirements to get approval. However, in recent years there has been an influx of other credit cards that provide help for people build their credit history, McClary said. If you are looking to build your credit score, McClary recommends you consider secure credit cards. These cards are considered secure because the lender usually asks for a deposit and the line of credit is lower than other credit cards. Once you’ve used secure credit cards and built your credit report, you can graduate to a traditional credit card. Since Buy Now, Pay Later services became available, retail stores have been offering them to customers along with store credit cards. It’s important to understand the differences. Store credit cards work like traditional credit cards. By filling out an application, you request a soft inquiry in your credit report and if you decide to get the credit card, this line of credit will be reflected in your credit score. Buy Now, Pay Later services are not shown in your credit report and they are usually tied to a specific purchase and are not a revolving line of credit. “Companies like Affirm, Afterpay and Klarna have been cutting into the market share of store credit cards because they fill a similar kind of niche,” Rossman said. Both with store credit cards and BNPL services, customers should proceed with caution to avoid getting caught overspending which can lead to great amounts of debt, he added.

        "headline": "What the Fed’s rate cut could mean for you",
        "date": "September 18, 2024",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — The Federal Reserve has cut its benchmark interest rate from its 23-year high, with consequences for debt, savings, auto loans, mortgages and other forms of borrowing by consumers and businesses. On Wednesday, the Fed announced that it reduced its key rate by an unusually large half-percentage point, to between 4.75 and 5 percent, the first rate cut in more than four years. The central bank is acting because, after imposing 11 rate hikes dating back to March 2022, it feels confident that inflation is finally mild enough that it can begin to ease the cost of borrowing. At the same time, the Fed has grown more concerned about the health of the job market. Lower rates would help support the pace of hiring and keep unemployment down. “Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace,” the Fed said in a statement. “Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low. Inflation has made further progress.” More Fed rate cuts are expected in the coming months, with the steepness of the reductions dependent on the direction of inflation and job growth. “We know that it is time to recalibrate our (interest rate) policy to something that’s more appropriate given the progress on inflation,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference. “The labor market is actually in solid condition and our intention with our policy move today is to keep it there.” “We don’t think we’re behind — we think this is timely,” he added. “But I think you can take this as a sign of our commitment not to get behind.” Although taking action now to try to capitalize on lower rates, like shifting money out of a certificate of deposit or refinancing a mortgage, “might be warranted for some, you shouldn’t feel obligated to completely change up your financial strategy just because rates move lower,” said Jacob Channel, a senior economist at LendingTree. “Act cautiously and responsibly,” Channel said, “and don’t make any rash decisions based on a single Fed meeting or economic report.” Eventually, yields for savers will decline as the Fed lowers its benchmark rate. “As attractive as yields on savings instruments have recently been, it’s wise not to hold too much in cash because these are short-term instruments and their yields are ephemeral,” said Christine Benz, director of personal finance at Morningstar. “The really great yields that we’ve had recently may go lower.” If you don’t have a need for cash right away, you can continue to lock in what are “still pretty decent yields on offer,” she said. In that case, “longer-term certificates of deposit might make sense.” “Lower interest rates make it harder to maximize savings and preserve the capital built while interest rates have been higher,” said Matt Brannon, a personal finance expert at MarketWatch guides. “An easy short-term move to protect your savings is to shift your funds into a high-yield savings account, which offers higher interest rates than traditional savings accounts... These types of savings accounts will still help you to preserve capital due to comparatively higher interest rates.” “While lower rates are certainly a good thing for those struggling with debt, the truth is that this one rate cut isn’t really going to make much of a difference for most people,” said Matt Schulz, a credit analyst at LendingTree. That said, the Fed’s declining benchmark rate will eventually mean better rates for borrowers, many of whom are facing some of the highest credit card interest rates in decades. The average interest rate is 23.18% for new offers and 21.51% for existing accounts, according to WalletHub’s August Credit Card Landscape Report. Still, “the best thing people can do to lower interest rates is to take matters into their own hands,” Schulz said. “Consolidating your debts with a 0% balance transfer credit card or a low-interest personal loan can have a far bigger impact on your debt load than most anything the Fed will do.” The Fed’s benchmark rate doesn’t directly set or correspond to mortgage rates. But it does have a major indirect influence, and the two “tend to move in the same direction,” said LendingTree’s Channel. To wit, mortgage rates have already declined ahead of the Fed’s predicted cut. “It goes to show that even when the Fed isn’t doing anything and just holding steady, mortgage rates can still move,” he said. Channel said that the majority of Americans have mortgages at 5%, so rates may have to fall further than their current average of 6.46% before many people consider refinancing. “With auto loans, it’s good news that rates will be falling, but it doesn’t change the basic blocking and tackling of things, which is that it’s still really important to shop around and not just accept the rate that a car dealer would offer you at the dealership,” said Greg McBride, an analyst at Bankrate. “It’s also really important to save what you can and be able to try to put as much down on that vehicle as you can.” McBride predicts that the rate cuts and the avoidance of a recession will lead to lower auto loan rates, at least for borrowers with strong credit profiles. For those with lower credit profiles, double digit rates will likely persist for the remainder of the year. Robert Frick, corporate economist for Navy Federal Credit Union, said that while he thinks a rate cut will work its way into auto loans, it probably won’t happen immediately and people with higher credit scores will likely benefit first. Loans for new vehicles right now are averaging 7.1%, with used vehicle loans at a much higher 11.3%, according to Edmunds.com. Those rates, coupled with still-high prices, have sent many possible buyers to the sidelines waiting for rates to drop. Partly as a result, U.S. new vehicle sales rose only a sluggish 2.4% through June. High prices and rates have also led to more delinquent payments and defaults on auto loans, especially among people with lower credit scores. As a result, Frick said, many lenders will probably try to keep rates high to cover potential losses. “Rates will be coming down, but we shouldn’t expect them to come down quickly overall,” he said. Frick suggests waiting for additional Fed rate cuts to come through if possible, especially if you’re buying a used vehicle. Jeff Schuster, vice president of automotive research for Global Data, said he doubts that modest rate cuts by the Fed will be enough to draw many buyers off the sidelines, unless automakers offer their own low-interest loans and other discounts. “I think it’s going to take a couple more cuts before we get any substantial relief for those consumers,” he said. Consumer prices rose 2.5% in August from a year earlier, down from 2.9% in July — the fifth straight annual drop and the smallest since February 2021. Hiring picked up a bit in August, and the unemployment rate dipped for the first time since March. Employers added 142,000 jobs, up from 89,000 in July. The unemployment rate declined to 4.2% from 4.3%, which had been the highest level in nearly three years. Those signs indicate that the job market, though cooling, remains sturdy. The rate at which the Fed continues to cut rates after September will depend in part on what happens next with inflation and the job market, in the coming weeks and months.

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Tech behemoth Oracle has agreed to settle a class action lawsuit for $115 million over allegations that it tracked consumer activity both on and offline. The suit alleges Oracle captured, compiled, and sold individuals’ data to third parties without their consent. Oracle maintains its practices were lawful, that it disclosed its activities, and it admitted no wrongdoing. Under the class action settlement, Oracle will pay $115 million to establish a settlement fund, and anyone residing in the United States from August 19, 2018 to the present who was affected may be eligible to file a claim. The fund will also cover up to $28.75 million for attorneys fees and other costs. All valid claimants will receive the same amount of money, which is dependent on how many people file. If you browsed the web, used geolocation services, or made in-store purchases electronically during the six-year period addressed in the settlement, you may be eligible. Allegedly, Oracle Advertising improperly collected personal data from these activities and subsequently sold or made that data available to third parties. The company allegedly did so using Oracle Advertising products including ID Graph and Data Marketplace. “All natural persons residing in the United States whose personal information, or data derived from their personal information, was acquired, captured, or otherwise collected by Oracle Advertising technologies or made available for use or sale by or through ID Graph, Data Marketplace, or any other Oracle Advertising product or service from August 19, 2018 to the date of final judgment in the Action” are eligible, according to the settlement website . The court will decide whether to approve the proposed settlement at a hearing on November 14, 2024.  Claims may be filed online on the official settlement website or by mail. Claims must be filed by October 17, 2024. Shares of Oracle Corp, based in Austin, Texas, rose slightly on Friday. “The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

        "headline": "US consumer watchdog finds that school lunch fees are taking a toll on parents",
        "date": "September 11, 2024",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Single mother Rebecca Wood, 45, was already dealing with high medical bills in 2020 when she noticed she was being charged a $2.49 “program fee” each time she loaded money onto her daughter’s school lunch account. As more schools turn to cashless payment systems, more districts have contracted with processing companies that charge as much as $3.25 or 4% to 5% per transaction, according to a new report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The report found that though legally schools must offer a fee-free option to pay by cash or check, there’s rarely transparency around it. “It wouldn’t have been a big deal if I had hundreds of dollars to dump into her account at the beginning of the year,” Wood said. “I didn’t. I was paying as I went, which meant I was paying a fee every time. The $2.50 transaction fee was the price of a lunch. So I’d pay for six lunches, but only get five.” The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the federal policy on fee-free school lunch, has mandated that districts inform families of their options since 2017, but even when parents are aware, having to pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome. “It’s just massively inconvenient,” said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two school-aged children. Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the $3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch account transactions, she and her husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead.  “A dollar here and there, I expected,” she said. “But $3.25 per transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of living is a lot lower — as are the salaries — is a lot.” Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day, for two working parents, was an increased burden of time and effort. For the past two years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free lunches in school, which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at any point. In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S., the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37 or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a child’s account. For families with lower incomes who can’t afford to load large sums in one go, those fees can hit weekly or even more frequently, increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to the report. In Wood’s case, she researched the fees and learned about the USDA requirement to offer fee-free payment by cash or by check. When she pointed this out to the superintendent of her daughter’s Massachusetts school district, the administrator said the lack of transparency was an oversight. To protest, Wood had planned to pay for her daughter’s lunches in coins at the school office, together with other parents. But then the pandemic hit, changing, among other things, school lunch policy. In subsequent years, Wood became part of a campaign that successfully pushed for universal free school lunches in the state, but she continues to protest school processing fees for families. “Even if lunch itself is free, if you want to buy something a la carte, or an extra lunch, or some other transaction, you still have to pay that fee,” Wood said. “They take money from people who need it the most.” While payment companies maintain that school districts have the chance to negotiate fees and rates when they form their contracts, the CFPB found that complex company structures “may insulate companies from competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate.” Just three companies — MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe, and LINQ Connect — dominate the market, according to the report. Without the ability to choose which company to work with, “families have fewer ways to avoid harmful practices,” the agency said, “including those that may violate federal consumer protection law.” The companies named in the report did not respond to requests for comment. Know that you always have a right to pay by cash or check, under federal policy. You can also request that your school district negotiate down the fees with their payment processing company, or request that the district cover the fees directly, which can give them leverage in negotiating a contract. If your school is located in a low-income area, you may also check whether your district qualifies for the Community Eligibility Provision , which would allow the school to provide free breakfast and lunch to all enrolled students.

        "headline": "Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck may not have had a prenuptial agreement, but you should consider one",
        "date": "August 29, 2024",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Longtime celebrity watchers may not have been shocked when Jennifer Lopez filed for divorce from Ben Affleck, but what was surprising was that Lopez’s divorce petition did not include any mention of a prenuptial agreement. A prenup is a legal document for soon-to-be-married couples that lays out how they will divide their assets during their marriage and if they divorce. They’re common for celebrities and very wealthy couples, but divorce law attorney Raiford Dalton Palmer says you should consider one even if you don’t have a lot of money . “Prenups are not just for rich people,” said Palmer, who is a managing shareholder of STG Divorce Law. “They can be very important for people that don’t have as much money because every dollar spent on attorney’s fees is a dollar that you’re not able to spend on your children or yourself.” If you plan to get married soon, here’s what you need to know about prenuptial agreements: This article is part of AP’s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well. When approaching the topic with your significant other, timing is key. Family law attorney Linda J. Ravdin recommends that you have the conversation sooner rather than later and don’t wait until you’re halfway through organizing your wedding. “As soon as they start talking about marriage, the person who wants the prenup should be saying something,” Ravdin said. It’s also important to be aware of your state’s deadline to submit a prenuptial agreement. For example, California has a seven-day rule, which means that one person needs to present a preliminary prenuptial agreement seven days before the other person can sign it. This is meant to make sure the other person has enough time to review the document.  Talking about prenuptial agreements can be especially difficult since it involves full transparency about your finances. To avoid conflict or hurt feelings, attorney Julia Rodgers recommends approaching the conversation gently. “It’s just as much an emotional document as it is a legal one,” said Rodgers, who is the CEO of Hello Prenup, an online prenuptial agreement platform. Rodgers recommends discussing why you want a prenup and your fears surrounding it. One common reason younger people cite for wanting a prenup is witnessing how difficult their parents’ divorces were. You should discuss what assets you have and how you would divide them if you happen to divorce. This is also the time to have important conversations about expectations during your marriage . Rodgers recommends asking the following questions: — Do you want kids? If so, are both people going to continue working? — If you don’t want kids, what kind of lifestyle do you want? — Do you want to buy a house or rent? — How often do you want to take a long vacation? — What type of debt do you have? — Do you want to open a business in the future? Prenuptial agreements can be equated to estate planning, Palmer said. Couples don’t get married expecting they will divorce, but planning in case it does happen can save them headaches and money. “It’s really appropriate for people that want to make divorce less painful, less expensive and they have property they wish to protect,” Palmer said. With or without a prenuptial agreement, going through a divorce will take lots of time and money. But having a prenup can ease the conversations about the division of property, alimony and debt. However, prenuptial agreements don’t include child support or any other topics related to children. A common misconception about prenups is that they benefit the highest-earning spouse, but this is not true, Rodgers said. Because prenuptial agreements are drafted by both parties, with their respective lawyers, they ideally protect both spouses. Prenuptial agreements are not only useful if the couple divorces. Because they lay out finances and future planning, they can also be used to lay out expectations from both parties during the marriage and in case of death. If you don’t have a prenup, what happens when you divorce will depend on the law in your state. Every state has default laws that establish how the division of property is handled in divorces. These laws typically try to divide the assets equally, but that’s not always the case, Palmer said. Any debt or new property acquired during the marriage would also be divided according to state law. “If you take on student loan debt during your marriage, that student loan debt could be considered marital or community property, depending on what state you’re in,” Rodgers said. In some states, like California, if a couple doesn’t have a prenuptial agreement, they are required to divide their assets in half. In other states, such as Iowa and Colorado, the distribution will be proportional but not equal. Oftentimes in these states, aspects like earning potential and financial needs are considered. Once you’re ready to start drafting a prenup, you each need a lawyer to help you write or review it. Ravdin first asks clients to fill out a worksheet where they can lay down what they’re looking for in the prenuptial agreement and use this as a blueprint for the draft. “If it’s clear what they want or what’s acceptable to both of them, I can go ahead and draft the agreement,” Ravdin said. The price of the prenuptial agreements process depends on your state and your attorney. In many cases, prenuptial agreements start from $1,000.

        "headline": "How to prepare for the Fed’s forthcoming interest rate cuts",
        "date": "August 23, 2024",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — The Federal Reserve is poised to cut its benchmark interest rate next month from its 23-year high, with consequences for consumers when it comes to debt, savings, auto loans and mortgages. Right now, most experts envision three quarter-point Fed cuts — in September, November and December — though even steeper rate cuts are possible. “The time has come” for the Fed to reduce interest rates, Powell said Friday in his keynote speech at the Fed’s annual economic conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming . “The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.” Based on Powell’s remarks and recent economic data, the central bank is expected to cut its key rate by a quarter-point when it meets next month and to carry out additional rate cuts in the coming months. Here’s what consumers should know: According to Greg McBride, chief credit analyst for Bankrate, savers should lock in attractive yields right now, before the expected rate cuts begin. “For those who might be looking at Certificates of Deposit or bonds — you want to jump on that now,” he said. “There is not a benefit to waiting because interest rates are going to be moving lower.” McBride stressed that anyone closer to retirement has a good opportunity to lock in CDs at the current relatively high rates. “If you do so, you’ll provide yourself a predictable flow of interest income at rates that should outpace inflation by a pretty healthy margin,” said McBride.  “Your credit card bill is not going to plunge the day after the next Fed meeting,” cautions LendingTree chief credit analyst Matt Schulz. “Nobody should expect miracles.” That said, the declining benchmark rate will eventually mean better rates for borrowers, many of whom are facing some of the highest credit card interest rates in decades. The average interest rate is 23.18% for new offers and 21.51% for existing accounts, according to WalletHub’s August Credit Card Landscape Report. Still, “it’s really important for people to understand that rates probably aren’t going to fall that quickly,” Schulz said. He said it’s important to take steps such as seeking a 0% interest balance transfer or a low-interest personal loan. You can also call your credit card issuer to see if you can negotiate a better rate. “In the short term, those things will have a much bigger effect than falling interest rates,” Schulz said. The Federal Reserve’s benchmark rate doesn’t directly set or correspond to mortgage rates, but it does have an influence, and the two “tend to move in the same direction,” said LendingTree senior economist Jacob Channel. In recent weeks, mortgage rates have already declined ahead of the Fed’s predicted cut, he pointed out. “It goes to show that even when the Fed isn’t doing anything and just holding steady, mortgage rates can still move,” Channel said. Melissa Cohn, the regional vice president of William Raveis Mortgage, echoed this, saying that the most important thing is what signal the Fed is sending to the market, rather than the rate change itself. “I’ve heard from a lot of people who locked in (their mortgage rate) over the course of the past 18 months, when rates were at their peak, already asking whether it’s time to refinance and what savings they could have,” she said. “I think that the outlook is good, and hopefully that spills into the real estate market, and we get more buyers in the market.” Channel said that the majority of Americans have mortgages at 5%, so rates may have to fall further than their current average of 6.46% before many people consider refinancing. “With auto loans, it’s good news that rates will be falling, but it doesn’t change the basic blocking and tackling of things, which is that it’s still really important to shop around and not just accept the rate that a car dealer would offer you at the dealership,” said Bankrate’s McBride. “It’s also really important to save what you can and be able to try to put as much down on that vehicle as you can.” McBride does predict that the beginning of rate cuts and the avoidance of a recession will lead to lower auto loan rates in 2024 — at least for borrowers with strong credit profiles. For those with lower credit profiles, double digit rates will likely persist for the remainder of the year. Last week, the government reported that consumer prices rose just 2.9% in July from a year ago, the smallest increase in over three years. Employment data, however, gives some economists pause. New data has showed hiring in July was much less than expected and the jobless rate has reached 4.3% , the highest in three years — one measure of a weakening economy. That said, robust retail sales have helped quell fears of a recession. The rate at which the Fed continues to cut rates after September will depend in part on what happens next with inflation and the job market, in the coming weeks and months.

        "headline": "Wrongful death suit against Disney serves as a warning to consumers when clicking ‘I agree’",
        "date": "August 16, 2024",
        "content": "A wrongful death lawsuit against Walt Disney Parks and Resorts is serving as a reminder to consumers of the importance of reading the fine print when signing up for a streaming service or smartphone app. The lawsuit was filed by the family of a New York woman who died after eating at a restaurant in Disney Springs, an outdoor dining, shopping and entertainment complex in Florida owned by Disney. Disney is arguing that the lawsuit should be dropped because the plaintiff, the woman’s husband, once signed up for a trial subscription of the Disney+ streaming service. That service, they argue, includes a subscriber agreement in which the customer agrees to settle any lawsuits against Disney out of court through arbitration. Such agreements, which customers quickly consent to by clicking “I agree” when downloading an app or a streaming service, are so stacked against the consumer that it’s often difficult to offer good legal advice, said John Davisson, director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The consumer is presented with this contract and really doesn’t have an opportunity to negotiate the terms,” Davisson said. “It’s yes or no.”  Kanokporn Tangsuan’s family says in the lawsuit that the 42-year-old New York doctor had a fatal allergic reaction after eating at an Irish pub in Disney Springs. The lawsuit claims Tangsuan and her husband, Jeffrey Piccolo, and his mother decided to eat at Raglan Road in October 2023 because it was billed on Disney’s website as having “allergen free food.” The suit alleges Tangsuan informed their server numerous times that she had a severe allergy to nuts and dairy products, and that the waiter “guaranteed” the food was allergen-free. About 45 minutes after finishing their dinner, Tangsuan had difficulty breathing while out shopping, collapsed and died at a hospital, according to the lawsuit. A medical examiner determined she died as a result of “anaphylaxis due to elevated levels of dairy and nut in her system,” the lawsuit said. Disney said in a statement this week that it is “deeply saddened” by the family’s loss but stressed that the Irish pub, which also is being sued, is neither owned nor operated by the company. More notably from a consumer protection standpoint, Disney argues that Piccolo had agreed to settle any lawsuits against Disney out of court through arbitration when he signed up for a one-month trial of Disney+ in 2019 and acknowledged that he had reviewed the fine print. “The first page of the Subscriber Agreement states, in all capital letters, that ‘any dispute between You and Us, Except for Small Claims, is subject to a class action waiver and must be resolved by individual binding arbitration’,” the company wrote in a motion seeking to have the case dismissed. Arbitration allows people to settle disputes without going to court and generally involves a neutral arbitrator who reviews arguments and evidence before making a binding decision, or award. Piccolo’s lawyer, in a response filed this month, argued that it was “absurd” to believe that the more than 150 million subscribers to Disney+ have waived all rights to sue the company and its affiliates in perpetuity — especially when their case has nothing to do with the popular streaming service. While it’s difficult to give consumers actionable advice when such agreements are so lopsided in favor of companies, Davisson suggested supporting lawmakers and regulators who are attentive to these issues. The Federal Trade Commission has historically supported the idea of disclosure terms protecting companies, even though the agreements are often dense and hard for typical consumers to comprehend. But Davisson says there has been a shift among policymakers and federal regulators. “Generally, it’s understood that it is literally impossible for consumers to read and interpret and fully understand all of the contracts that they’re being asked and expected by the law to agree to and abide by as they go about their day,” he said. “Especially in an increasingly online world in which we’re interacting with dozens or hundreds of platforms and services a day.” Lewis reported from New York and Murphy from Oklahoma City."

        "date": "August 14, 2024",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — If you’ve noticed that you’re paying more than before for the same amount of groceries, you’re not the only one. Inflation is easing , but grocery prices are still high — up 21%, on average, since inflation started to surge more than three years ago. Unlike some other items, you can’t just stop buying groceries when they get pricey. There’s nothing you can do about inflation, but you can find ways to save on groceries so they don’t heavily affect your wallet or your eating habits. These include using coupons, budgeting and buying in bulk. Here’s are some expert recommendations for saving on groceries: Kiersten Torok started using coupons back when she was in high school, after her parents lost their jobs during the 2008 recession. She began relying on them even more in 2020, when she lost her own job during the pandemic. Now she’s using her social media platform to help others learn how to save. “When times like these come up, coupons are a necessity for so many Americans,” said Torok, known on Instagram and TikTok as Torok Coupon Hunter . Many might think that using coupons means cutting them out of a magazine. While you can certainly still do that, there are now easier ways to get the discounts. Many stores, like Walmart and Target, have coupons available on their apps. “All you have to do is scan an item in a store, the coupons pop up on your app and then they automatically apply in the register,” Torok said. “It’s become much more streamlined.” This article is part of AP’s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well. One of Torok’s coupon golden rules is: Never pay big for toothpaste — there’s always a combination of coupons and offers available. For anyone who wants to try couponing, Torok recommends that you first start using them at your favorite store and never buy things you don’t need, even if there’s a big discount. Apps like Flipp , which lets you browse for coupons from all major grocery stores, and Ibotta , an app that gives you cashback for using coupons, can make your journey with couponing easier. Making a budget is a key to keeping grocery spending under control, and the first step is to track how much you’re already spending. Start by reviewing how much you have spent on the last few times you’ve gone grocery shopping, recommended David Brindley, deputy editor for AARP Bulletin . If you don’t keep receipts from past grocery runs, try looking at your bank account statement and adding up the grocery charges. Once you know how much you spend on groceries, set a goal, for example, staying within a specific budget or reducing your spending. You need a plan, but before you make one, ensure you know what you currently have in your fridge and your pantry. Sarah Schweisthal, personal finance expert and social media manager at budgeting app YNAB , recommends taking everything out and making an inventory so you don’t buy duplicates of things you already have on hand. Brindley also recommends planning to cook multiple meals with similar ingredients, which saves money and also cuts down on food waste. Once you’ve tracked your spending and inventoried what you already have, the next step is to make a plan. Write down the items you’re looking to buy and your estimated cost, making sure you stay on budget. Meal planning for the week or month can be a good way to stay on top of your spending, Schweisthal said. Going up and down the aisles can sometimes make you crave things that you haven’t planned for, like a snack or a new dish. If you foresee that it’ll be hard for you to stick to your list, include some flexibility in your plan, such as allotting a specific amount to buy snacks or a random item you see at the checkout line. “I think having flexibility in a plan actually helps you stick to it more,” Schweisthal said. Making a plan can be as simple as writing down a list on paper or in your phone’s notes app. Or, you can use apps that specifically help you with meal planning such as AnyList or Mealime . If you tend to wander off your grocery list because every time you go to the store you buy things you don’t need, shopping online and picking up curbside is a good workaround. “I 100% recommend sitting down Sunday morning and just looking at the stores and comparing the items you need for the week, especially with things you can get for curbside pickup,” Torok said. If you buy your groceries from multiple stores because each has better prices on some items, ordering ahead of time can also save time. If you are in charge of buying groceries for your entire family, it can be beneficial to include them in your grocery budgeting routine. For Torok, this has meant teaching her children how to scan coupons while they shop. Since buying in bulk can be very cost-effective. Brindley also recommends that you team up with a friend or a family member to buy specific items in bulk and share the discount. Lastly, you can save money by using food-sharing apps such as Olio, which connects people around their community to share extra grocery items, and Too Good to Go, where you can buy surplus food at a discount.

        "date": "August 12, 2024",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Unexpectedly high medical bills are common in the United States , but there are ways to get relief. According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, one in five Americans are affected by outstanding medical debt, for a total cost of $88 billion. In a 2022 study, the bureau found that roughly 20% of U.S. households report that they have medical debt, with collections appearing on 43 million credit reports. As of the second quarter of 2021, 58% of all bills in collections on credit records were medical bills. Medical debt affects households unevenly, too, according to the agency. Past-due bills are more prevalent among Black and Hispanic people than white and Asian people, and medical debt is more common in the Southern U.S., in part because states in that region did not expand Medicaid coverage. While the process of fighting high medical bills can be time-consuming and frustrating, advocates stress that patients shouldn’t be intimidated by the system. If you’ve received a surprise medical bill, here’s what you should know : This article is part of AP’s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well. When Luisa, 33, received a medical bill for over $1,000 after an emergency hospital visit for a viral infection, she was able to have the whole amount covered by the hospital after appealing to their financial assistance policy. “At first I thought it was just a cold, but it turned out to be something I needed specific medication for,” said Luisa, who asked to be identified only by her first name due to privacy concerns. “It was really bad by the time I went to the ER.” Luisa had heard about the patient advocacy organization Dollar For thanks to a viral video, and she filled out the nonprofit’s online form after receiving her surprise bill. The organization contacted the hospital, which was based in central Florida. Eventually, the hospital contacted Luisa directly to let her know she did in fact qualify for financial assistance. Even though she had already paid a portion of the costs with a credit card, Dollar For was able to get those payments refunded.  Laws governing hospital charity care require that nonprofit hospitals lower or write off bills for individuals, depending on household income. To determine if you qualify, you can simply Google the hospital along with the phrase “charity care” or “financial assistance policy.” Dollar For also provides a simplified online tool for patients to see if they qualify. “Federal law requires hospitals to have these programs to keep their tax-exempt status,” said Jared Walker, CEO of Dollar For. “If you’re within their income range, they will write off, waive, forgive, or reduce your bills.” Even if you’ve already been paying off medical debt, the hospital will be required to refund the payments you’ve made, he said. “It was my first time going through something like that,” Luisa said. “I tried to be an informed consumer and ask questions when I was in the hospital about the costs, but obviously it’s hard when you’re sick in the emergency room.” While protections against surprise bills have long existed for those who have Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare, laws are now also in place for those with private or marketplace insurance. The federal No Surprises Act covers people who have insurance through their employers, the marketplace, or individual plans. It says that insurance companies must reasonably cover any out-of-network services related to emergency and some non-emergency medical care. That means that if you’re being charged more than you’re used to or expect when you receive in-network services, that bill may be illegal. To challenge any bill covered under this law, you can use the free help desk and hotline of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services . Many states also have free consumer assistance programs to help with disputes and insurance questions. You can always contact the medical billing department of any hospital in writing to say that you believe a bill is in violation of the No Surprises Act and ask the hospital to deal directly with your insurance company. “The complexity of the system itself is as big a problem as affordability,” said Kaye Pastaina, who heads research on patient protections for KFF, a nonprofit health policy organization. “A lot of it is from the fragmented system and complex rules, but also lack of awareness about existing protections that are a part of federal law that might help.” Even if you don’t qualify for charity care or you’re not sure your bills are covered by the No Surprises Act, you may be able to reduce the charges. Medical billing is notoriously byzantine and rife with errors. Anytime you receive a bill, ask the hospital or healthcare provider for an itemized bill that includes the billing codes of all the care you received. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) mandates that providers share this information. Next, check whether the billing codes are accurate. Again, simply Googling the codes with the phrase “medical billing code” can help. If something is off, contesting your bill with your medical provider or physician’s office can yield changes. Another approach: comparing the bill with insurance companies’ estimates of fair charges for services. If the price you were charged is more than average, you can have your costs lowered. You could even take the provider to small claims court over the discrepancy (or let them know you have a case). Finally, compare your insurance company’s “explanation of benefits” to the bill. This explanation of costs covered and not covered must match the hospital’s bill. If they don’t, you have another reason not to pay, and to ask the provider to work with your insurance company further first. Despite the hassle, these steps can save you considerable sums of money. Even after taking these steps, you can always appeal health claims with your insurance company, if you think there is any reason the bills should be covered entirely or more than the company initially decided. You can also contact your state insurance commissioner for support. “What we’ve seen in our research and the data is that those folks who appeal — and there are few who appeal — but for those who appeal, there’s a high level of overturning,” Pastaina said.

        "headline": "What investors should do when there is more volatility in the market",
        "date": "August 06, 2024",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are bouncing back after the market experienced its worst day in two years on Monday , but the average investor may still be understandably spooked. Over a three day losing streak, the S&P 500 dipped more than 6% before rallying again Tuesday, up 1.6% in midday trading. “This is what an emotion-driven market looks like,” said Mark Hackett, head of investment research for Nationwide. “You had a three day period that was really very challenging. But the drop was not justified by the data that was out there, which is why you then have a day like today.” For everyday people, what are the best ways to handle market volatility? The top advice is to do nothing, but ultimately your response depends in part on your circumstances and financial goals. “It’s important to remember that investing in the stock market is a long game. There’s going to be volatility, so be wary of having a knee-jerk reaction and pulling your money out at the first sign of a drop,” said Courtney Alev, consumer advocate for CreditKarma. “Selling stocks frequently or incrementally can come with fees for each transaction and those can add up fast.” Caleb Silver, editor in chief of Investopedia, echoed this, cautioning that sellers may also end up owing taxes on any gains. “For everyday investors, volatility is the price you pay to be invested in the stock market,” Silver said. “But it’s very unsettling when we see big market drops of two to three percent… It’s a little unnerving for people who have their money in 401(k)’s or IRA’s or retirement funds to watch this magnitude of volatility.” Silver urged investors to remember that “a market falls into a correction, ten percent or more, once a year on average,” and that “usually the market reverts to the mean, and the mean is an average annual return of eight to ten percent a year going all the way back to the 1950s.” For younger people just beginning to invest, declines in the stock market are an opportunity to add to your portfolio at cheaper prices, by buying in when the market is falling or has fallen a lot, according to Silver. “You’re reducing the average price you pay for the securities, stocks, mutual funds, or index funds that you own (when you buy in a down market),” he said. “So when the market itself reverts to the mean and rises again, you take advantage of having bought at cheaper prices, and that adds to the value of your portfolio.” In terms of selling, though, he said the best advice for most investors is to do nothing and wait for the volatility to cool down. “Whenever you invest in stocks it’s important to be mindful of your time horizon,” said Alev. “For instance, do you expect you’ll need to liquidate in the near future? In that case, you’re likely better off opting for a less volatile and more risk-averse mode of growing your money, such as a high-yield savings account.” Silver agreed. “I don’t believe it when people say, ‘Don’t look at your 401(k),’” he said. “You should absolutely look and see what you own and see that it matches your risk appetite.” If it doesn’t, you can move your investments to products that can shield you from the ups and downs of the market or unforeseen events. Silver said that High Yield Savings Accounts, Certificates of Deposit, and money market accounts are all currently seeing returns of about 4% to 5% for the more cautious or conservative investor. Nationwide’s Hackett said it makes sense to periodically rebalance the exposure one has in their portfolio in general - whether quarterly or annually - to make sure there isn’t more risk than one would want related to, say, technology stocks or another sector. “If your exposures get out of line with your long-term plan, get them back in line,” he said. Even so, Hackett added that he sees the trend of tech stocks outperforming as one that may extend further into the future. Experts agree that, for investors with debt, it’s important to focus on paying off loans, especially high-interest ones, before making major investments. That said, “if you are able to simultaneously pay off your loans and invest a little bit at the same time, you are effectively paying your future self for being responsible about your debt while growing your investments over time,” Silver said.

        "headline": "Stores lure back-to-school shoppers with deals and ‘buy now, pay later’ plans",
        "date": "July 30, 2024",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Mass market retailers in the U.S. are plying shoppers with offers for computers, clothes and other back-to-school essentials at affordable prices. To seal the deal, they are marketing “buy now, pay later” services as a way for customers to spread out the cost of going back to class in style. The strategies for securing sales are on display to coax consumers, particularly those in lower income brackets, into spending during the retail world’s second-most important period behind the winter holidays, retailers and analysts said. Various forecasts project back-to-school sales this year will be about the same or lower than last year. Even as inflation has come down, the costs of food, rent and other necessities remain much higher than before the coronavirus pandemic . High interest rates have made it more expensive to carry a credit card balance. Savvy shoppers across the income spectrum have proven willing to shop second-hand and to buy store labels and brands , which are typically cheaper than nationally advertised brands. “Inflation is the main thing dictating the change in my spending,” Jasleen Reyes, 43, a mother of three who works as a hotel operations manager and lives in New York City’s Harlem neighborhood, said. “Before it wasn’t so bad. Now, I have to watch every dollar.” For Reyes, that means looking for more discounts, particularly when it comes to getting sneakers and jeans for her children. She also planned to use a “buy now, pay later,” or BNPL, plan to buy a laptop for her 24-year-old son, a college student, and school uniforms for one of her teenage daughters.  Reyes estimates she will spend $3,200-$3,400 on back-to-school items this year, about $1,500 more than last year mainly because of the laptop. She uses credit cards but prefers the four installment BNPL option because it splits up her costs over two months, interest-free, instead of adding them to a monthly bill that would accrue interest if she were unable to pay off the balance right away. Unlike gifting holidays such as Christmas and Valentine’s Day, the back-to-school period is dominated by spending on essentials like class supplies and replacing clothes and shoes that kids have outgrown. But like the winter holidays , the back-to-school shopping season keeps starting earlier. One reason is Amazon’s Prime Day. Rivals hoping to capture some of the online behemoth’s momentum have helped make July a good month for discounts. Target, for example, offered 20 school supplies, including notebooks and colored pencils, that together cost less than $20. The discount retailer moved the sale to the third week of June from the first week of July a year ago. More people are using “buy now, pay later” services heading into the back-to-school season. In June, $6.75 billion worth of online purchases in the U.S. were made with BNPL services, a 14.3% increase from the same month a year ago, according to Adobe Analytics data. Many shoppers appreciate the flexibility of “buy now, pay later,” but consumer advocates have expressed concerns that the growth of the payment method may reflect financial stress and ultimately leave Americans in more debt. BNPL company Afterpay said millennials made a majority of the back-to-school-related purchases on the platform from April through June, followed by members of Generation X. Spending for back-to-school products grew across “accessories, apparel, electronics, footwear and home furnishings,” a company spokesperson said. Afterpay data from May, June and July show a 65% year-over-year increase in backpack sales made through the company’s payment system, while sales of flashcards and electronic tablets grew by more than 50%. Sales of “school shorts,” “school skirts” and low-top sneakers purchased through Afterpay increased more than 100%. The National Retail Federation forecasts back-to-school sales will reach $38.8 billion this year, the second-highest figure since the group started recording the figures in 2007. Last year’s $41.5 billion still holds the record. “Households are dealing with inflation right now,” Jack Kleinhentz, the federation’s chief economist, said during a media briefing last week. “Even though it’s improving, they have to prioritize. They have to be more selective.” Professional services and consulting company Deloitte estimates back-to-school spending will reach $31.3 billion, essentially unchanged from $31.9 billion a year ago. Back-to-school shopping contributed to the record sales that Amazon reported from its 10th Prime Day event on July 16-17, with big spikes in spending for products such as backpacks, lunchboxes and stationary supplies, Adobe said. The tech company does not adjust its analytics data for inflation but said new demand, not higher prices, have fueled most increases in consumer spending this year. Chummy Tees, an online T-shirt company based in Sonora, California, has been running more deals compared with a year ago, founder Josh Neuman said. He said the shopping frenzy kicked off in late June; last year, business picked up in mid-July and intensified in August, Neuman said. “Seems like parents want to get ahead of the game to score the best deals and make sure their kids are set for the first day,” he said. For the back-to-college crowd, dorm supplies e-tailer Dormify is playing to both ends of the budget, according to co-founder Amanda Zuckerman. This season, Dormify created two different bundles, one for big spenders and one for customers on a budget. The 16-piece deluxe bundle starts at $329, while the “core” bundle starts at $199 and includes 27 items. The retailer also has lowered the starting prices for some items. For example, comforters start at $69, $30 lower than a year ago. Zuckerman said back-to-college spending, which usually kicks off in late May, kicked off this month. She thinks the late spending was due to the delays and glitches with the government’s Free Application for Federal Student Aid approval process after an updated version of the financial aid form was released.

        "headline": "US agency says apps that let workers access paychecks before payday are providing loans",
        "date": "July 18, 2024",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said Thursday that apps that allow workers to access their paychecks in advance , often for a fee, are providing loans and therefore subject to the Truth in Lending Act, a 1968 law that requires lenders disclose all loan costs and fees. If enacted, the proposed rule would provide clarity to a fast-growing industry known as Earned Wage Access, which has been compared to payday lending. The agency wants borrowers to be able to “easily compare products” and to prevent “race-to-the-bottom business practices,” CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said on a call with reporters. Earned Wage Access apps have been around for more than a decade, but they gained popularity in the years prior to the pandemic and since. The apps extend small short-term loans to workers in between paychecks so they can pay bills and meet everyday needs. On payday, the user repays the money out of their wages, along with any fees. According to its report, the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau found that, in 2022, at least 5% of American workers used an earned wage product at least once. They estimate that 7 million workers were advanced $22 billion through apps that worked with their employers, and 3 million workers were advanced $9.1 billion through direct-to-consumer apps. The agency’s research shows the average worker who uses Earned Wage Access takes out 27 of these loans a year, meaning one loan for almost every biweekly paycheck. This can look similar to a revolving credit card balance. But with fees that would equal an average Annual Percentage Rate (APR) of over 100%, the loans have interest rates higher than the most expensive subprime credit card. Most of this interest comes from fees to expedite access to paychecks, the CFPB found.  The typical user of these apps earns also less than $50,000 a year, according to the Government Accountability Office, and has experienced the pinch of two years of high inflation . Many of the apps charge monthly subscription fees and most charge mandatory fees for instant transfers of funds. Christine Zinner, policy counsel at Americans for Financial Reform, said the paycheck advance products “are nothing more than workplace payday loans, with consumers (being) more easily preyed upon since the money is only a tap away on a cell phone.” “People can easily become trapped in a cycle of debt by re-borrowing, requesting advances 12 to 120 times each year, just to pay basic household expenses and make ends meet,” she said. The CFPB also said it is paying close attention to the “tips” many of the apps request when providing advances on paychecks. On the call, Chopra called the practice odd, noting that many paycheck advance companies bring in “substantial revenues” from the so-called tips. In 2021, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation found “users often feel compelled to leave (tips) due to applied pressure tactics like... claiming tips are used to support other vulnerable consumers or for charitable purposes.” With the interpretive rule, the CFPB is clarifying that “if workers obtain money they are required to repay out of their paychecks, this is a loan under federal law, (and the companies) must disclose an interest rate.” This means that tips and fees for expedited transfers must be incorporated into the cost of the loan, under the disclosure scheme mandated by the Truth in Lending Act, and those costs may not be treated as “incidental, even if the amount is variable,” Chopra said. Some Earned Wage Access companies have argued these fees should not be treated as part of the standard APR calculation on the loans. When Connecticut passed a law capping the fees the apps could charge under its state usury limits, at least one Earned Wage Access company, EarnIn, stopped operating in the state. Asked why, EarnIn CEO Ram Palaniappan said it was no longer “economically viable.” Penny Lee, president of the Financial Technology Association, an industry group that counts many EWA companies as members, said her group is “deeply concerned” by the proposed action by the CFPB. “Earned Wage Access should not be considered a loan as it is a no-cost, non-recourse product giving access to money workers have already earned, not future pay,” she said in a prepared statement, adding the proposed rule would “hurt millions of workers who rely on Earned Wage Access to tap into their already earned wages.” In its report, the CFPB found that, despite companies marketing these services as free for workers in non-employer subsidized transactions, “most workers paid at least one fee and nearly all workers opt to pay a fee for expedited access to their funds.” The CFPB said that with nearly 50% of earned wage product users turning to the service more than once a month, “costs may accumulate for workers who are frequently paid by the hour, have liquidity constraints, and receive public benefits.” The agency will take comments on the proposed interpretive rule until the end of August. “Today’s report and rule are important steps for the CFPB to ensure the market is working,” Chopra said. “We want to see the market compete down costs for employees and employers.” The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

        "headline": "Amazon Prime Day deals are almost here. Should you take advantage of them?",
        "date": "July 16, 2024",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — It’s summertime, and the bargains seem easy at a time when many consumer prices are high. July sales events have become a seasonal revenue driver for the retail industry since Amazon launched its first Prime Day back in 2015. While consumers may be enticed by the advertised can’t-miss savings on some products, personal finance experts say shoppers should be careful not to fall for potentially misleading marketing or give in to impulse buys. Amazon has drummed up expectations in recent weeks for its 10th Prime Day event , which will be held on Tuesday and Wednesday and is open only to customers who pay $14.99 per month, or $139 per year, to receive free shipping and other perks as Prime members . Rival retailers tried in the past to capture some of the Prime Day excitement by offering their own discounts during the two-day event. This year, Walmart, Target, Kohl’s, and newcomers TikTok Shop and Temu launched summer promotions ahead of Amazon, hoping to siphon off some of the e-commerce giant’s savings-hungry shoppers. Meanwhile, Macy’s will be rolling out what it calls its “best summer deals” during an eight-day discount event that begins on Tuesday.  July sales help retailers attract customers who are looking to get a head start on back-to-school shopping, which is the industry’s second-most important shopping season behind the winter holiday period. The markdowns also pull in some discretionary spending from shoppers who’ve had their eyes on gadgets, household products and seasonal items , such as a bikini or a new summer dress. Discounts can help retailers combat “a summer lull in retail spending” as consumers shift their spending to summer vacations and services, like going out to eat at restaurants, according to John Mercer, the head of global research at Coresight Research. “It drives a bit of excitement in that mid-year period,” when retailers may otherwise struggle to generate more revenue, Mercer said. Companies also have relied on discounts to drive consumer spending during the recent period of inflation and high interest rates, he said. Amazon doesn’t disclose how much revenue it pulls in from Prime Day, but it has given some indications of its success. The company said last year’s event resulted in the “single largest sales day” in the company’s history, with customers purchasing more than 375 million items. An estimate from market research firm Emarketer indicated Amazon’s global sales on Prime Day went up to $12.5 billion in 2023. The firm forecasts sales to jump roughly 7% this year. It depends on who you ask. Retailers hype up their promotions to pull people in. But the New York Times-owned product review website Wirecutter published an article this month saying most of Amazon’s early deals this year so far “stink.” Santa Clara University business professor Kirthi Kalyanam, who is writing a book about Amazon, said Prime Day offers have been good, historically. That’s because the company was able to source discounts from well-known brands such as Apple and to incentivize third-party sellers to lower their prices by promising to feature them prominently on the Amazon website, according to Kalyanam. But Prime Day discounts may matter less these days because customers are getting accustomed to the ultra-cheap products sold by Amazon competitors Shein and Temu , which were both founded in China. “Many of (the) deals may not be as competitive compared to Temu and Shein,” Kalyanam said. At the same time, he noted rival retailers will most likely be looking at Amazon’s prices and trying to match them overnight. Last week, he said he saw Best Buy discount two products after Amazon revealed some of its early deals. Consumer data company Numerator reported that a majority of the roughly 5,000 Prime Day shoppers it surveyed after last year’s event saw product discounts of up to 40%. Survey respondents said they saw a quarter of items selling at a discount of 60% or more. Some shopping experts have said that some past Prime discounts were not as big as they appeared. If you’re watching your budget , personal finance experts say you should exercise caution before you buy. “Avoid the false sense of urgency of manufactured holidays,” advises Mark Elliot, chief customer officer at financial services company LendingClub. “The idea that ‘The more you spend, the more you save’ — that’s just definitionally not true.” Dan Egan, a vice president at financial advising and investment company Betterment, says shoppers should make a list of what they need before the sales begin to be intentional about purchases. He also encourages consumers to avoid shopping late at night or out of boredom. “Once you have a list, it’s less likely you’ll get distracted by things you don’t need,” Egan said. “If that list contains almost nothing, I would say to delete the (retailers’) apps off your phone for the next week or two. Or you’re going to get lots of notifications.” Any shopper already carrying a credit card balance should keep in mind that the interest paid on that balance could end up cancelling out any perceived savings from a summer sale purchase, he added. “A deal is not a deal if you have to pay interest on it,” Egan said. While it may make sense for shoppers to try out free or temporary memberships to qualify for the best deals during the summer sales, those programs typically charge a fee to the customer’s credit card on file after a short period of time, noted Erin Witte, the Consumer Federation of America’s director of consumer protection. “Set a calendar reminder to cancel if you don’t want to go through with that subscription,” Witte said. “Think about it right at the beginning. And remember that these companies design this product to make it easy to sign up, but more difficult to cancel.” Consumer Reports also offers a few tips: Download Amazon’s app, sign-up for invite-only deals available for a select group of shoppers, and join the waitlist on limited-time offers that are already sold out. Filling up an online Amazon cart is tempting for Prime members since they are paying for access to Prime Day deals. But it’s always a smart idea to compare prices across multiple websites before completing a purchase. Unlike Prime Day offers, Walmart’s discount event this month was open to everyone. However, the company sweetened the deal for its Walmart+ members by offering them early access. Target only offered discounts to shoppers enrolled in its Target Circle loyalty program and used the weeklong event to promote a new membership program that aims to rejuvenate sales and traffic. TikTok Shop, the e-commerce arm of the popular video-sharing app , opened its summer sales event to everyone. The event started on July 9 and runs until Wednesday.

        "date": "July 11, 2024",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — If you’ve noticed that you’re paying more than before for the same amount of groceries, you’re not the only one. Inflation is easing slightly , but grocery prices are still high — up 21% on average since inflation started to surge more than three years ago. “When inflation rises, it reduces people’s ability to afford groceries by increasing the overall cost of goods,” said Cassandra Happe, analyst for WalletHub. Unlike some other items, you can’t just stop buying groceries when they get pricey. There’s nothing you can do about inflation, but you can find ways to save on groceries so they don’t heavily impact your wallet or your eating habits. These include using coupons, budgeting, and buying in bulk. Here’s are some expert recommendations for saving on groceries: Kiersten Torok started using coupons back when she was in high school, after her parents lost their jobs during the 2008 recession. She began relying on them even more in 2020, when she lost her own job during the pandemic. Now she’s using her social media platform to help others learn how to save. “When times like these come up, coupons are a necessity for so many Americans,” said Torok, known on Instagram and TikTok as Torok Coupon Hunter . Many might think that using coupons means cutting them out of a magazine. While you can certainly still do that, there are now easier ways to get the discounts. Many stores, like Walmart and Target, have coupons available on their apps. This article is part of AP’s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well. “All you have to do is scan an item in a store, the coupons pop up on your app and then they automatically apply in the register,” Torok said. “It’s become much more streamlined.”  One of Torok’s coupon golden rules is: never pay for toothpaste — there’s always a combination of coupons and offers available. For anyone who wants to try couponing, Torok recommends that you first start using them at your favorite store and never buy things you don’t need, even if there’s a big discount. Apps like Flipp , which lets you browse for coupons from all major grocery stores, and Ibotta , an app that gives you cashback for using coupons, can make your journey with couponing easier. Making a budget is a key to keeping grocery spending under control, and the first step is to track how much you’re already spending. Start by reviewing how much you have spent on the last few times you’ve gone grocery shopping, recommended David Brindley, deputy editor for AARP Bulletin . If you don’t keep receipts from past grocery runs, try looking at your bank account statement and adding up the grocery charges. Once you know how much you spend on groceries, set a goal, for example, staying within a specific budget or reducing your spending.  You need a plan, but before you make one, ensure you know what you currently have in your fridge and your pantry. Sarah Schweisthal, personal finance expert and social media manager at budgeting app YNAB , recommends taking everything out and making an inventory so you don’t buy duplicates of things you already have on hand. Brindley also recommends planning to cook multiple meals with similar ingredients, which saves money and also cuts down on food waste. Once you’ve tracked your spending and inventoried what you already have, the next step is to make a plan. Write down the items you’re looking to buy and your estimated cost, making sure you stay on budget. Meal planning for the week or month can be a good way to stay on top of your spending, Schweisthal said. Going up and down the aisles can sometimes make you crave things that you haven’t planned for, like a snack or a new dish. If you foresee that it’ll be hard for you to stick to your list, include some flexibility in your plan, such as allotting a specific amount to buy snacks or a random item you see at the checkout line. “I think having flexibility in a plan actually helps you stick to it more,” Schweisthal said. Making a plan can be as simple as writing down a list on paper or in your phone’s notes app. Or, you can use apps that specifically help you with meal planning such as AnyList or Mealime . If you tend to wander off your grocery list because every time you go to the store you buy things you don’t need, shopping online and picking up curbside is a good workaround. “I 100% recommend sitting down Sunday morning and just looking at the stores and comparing the items you need for the week, especially with things you can get for curbside pickup,” Torok said. If you buy your groceries from multiple stores because each has better prices on some items, ordering ahead of time can also save time. If you are in charge of buying groceries for your entire family, it can be beneficial to include them in your grocery budgeting routine. For Torok, this has meant teaching her children how to scan coupons while they shop. Since buying in bulk can be very cost-effective. Brindley also recommends that you team up with a friend or a family member to buy specific items in bulk and share the discount. Lastly, you can save money by using food-sharing apps such as Olio, which connects people around their community to share extra grocery items, and Too Good to Go, where you can buy surplus food at a discount.

        "date": "June 27, 2024",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — With graduation season over, many college grads are embarking on summer internships or their first full-time jobs. Navigating your finances when you start adult life can be challenging, from understanding your health insurance and benefits to managing a budget. Finding a job is often the first hurdle, so if you’ve accomplished that, take a moment to be proud of yourself. “Once you do get that first job, pat yourself on the back,” said Nick Holeman, director of financial planning for Betterment, a financial advisory company. Then it’s time to think about your financial future. With credit card delinquencies growing and interest rates still high , it’s more important than ever for recent graduates to start their adult lives on the right financial track. Here are recommendations from experts about how to do that: Getting your first job is exciting, but the onboarding process can feel overwhelming. When you start a new job, most companies offer guidance about benefits such as your 401(k) and health insurance. It’s a lot of information, but it’s important not to ignore it, Holeman said. One key thing to focus on is your employer-sponsored retirement plan. While many companies automatically enroll you, Holeman recommends you save more than the typical 2% to 3%. Automatic enrollment allows your employer to take a set amount from your paycheck to allocate to a retirement investment account. You can choose to opt out or increase the amount you contribute. “Because you’re automatically enrolled doesn’t mean you can’t go in and increase how much you’re contributing,” he said. “And that’s a great way to build those automatic savings habits that around going to take you throughout the rest of your career.” Some recent grads might stay on their parents’ health insurance while others might enroll in an employers’ health insurance plan. But if your job doesn’t offer health insurance, experts recommend you enroll in the Affordable Care Act . “You shouldn’t go uninsured if you are going to be working for an employer that doesn’t offer health insurance,” said Louise Norris, health policy analyst for healthinsurance.org. While you’re navigating the ACA’s marketplace, you must take into consideration your budget, health, and availability of doctors in your area. If your employer offers several health insurance plans, Norris recommends learning the details of the plans, such as your deductible, co-pays and use policy. If you’re generally healthy and don’t go to the doctor often, Holeman recommends you choose a high-deductible health plan, because it will allow you to save money in a health savings account , also known as an HSA. An HSA lets you set aside pre-tax money to pay for medical expenses, which can help you cut out-of-pocket costs when you visit the doctor. Emergencies are tough to prepare for because you never know when they will happen and how expensive they will be. However, it’s a good practice to have an emergency fund that will alleviate some of the financial burden if something goes wrong. “Think of your emergency fund as a ‘break glass in case of emergency,’” said Holeman, who recommended that you keep your emergency savings in a separate bank account. Emergency fund amounts vary depending on each person’s circumstances but Holeman recommends that you save three to six months of expenses. This is an ideal scenario, but any amount of savings can be helpful in case of an emergency. Credit cards can help build your credit score and develop good borrowing habits, but if not used carefully, they can also get you in a lot of debt. If you’re taking out your first credit card, Holeman recommends that you choose something that you can keep for a long time, since an important factor in your credit score is the length of your credit history. Holeman recommends your first credit card is one that doesn’t have a yearly fee and is easy to maintain. If you’ve had a credit card before, remember that to maintain a good credit score and not fall into credit card debt, you must pay off your balance on time every month. It’s best if you use your credit card to pay for things you can already afford, recommended Steve Pilloff, associate professor of finance at Costello College of Business at George Mason University. “Use it as a way to make payments rather than a way to borrow money. Focus on the card and not the credit,” Pilloff said. Budgeting is a key component of your financial life, whether you’re trying to save for your emergency fund or pay down debt. Budgets change along with your finances, so when you land that first full-time position and maybe move to a new city, you need to change your budget to reflect your current financial reality, Pilloff said. If you’re using your budget to find ways to cut costs, Holeman recommends you focus on big expenses, such as rent or transportation costs, rather than small ones such as coffee or shopping. If you have debt, Holeman also recommends you first focus on paying off high-interest debt. If you don’t have debt, focusing on building an emergency fund and saving for short-term goals is also a great place to start setting goals for yourself. Budgeting is not a one-time process. In order to achieve your financial goals, you have to continuously assess and adjust, Pilloff said. With apps like YNAB and EveryDollar , you can access and easily modify your budget at any time. However, the best way to stick to a budget is finding the format that best works for you, whether that’s an Excel sheet or a notebook.

        "headline": "Credit card delinquencies are rising. Here’s what to do if you’re at risk",
        "date": "June 08, 2024",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Seriously overdue credit card debt is at the highest level in more than a decade, and people 35 and under are struggling more than other age groups to pay their bills. The share of credit card debt that’s severely delinquent, defined as being more than 90 days overdue, rose to 10.7% during the first quarter of 2024, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. A year ago, just 8.2% of credit card debt was severely delinquent. If you’re experiencing delinquency, or at risk of it, experts advise speaking with a nonprofit credit counselor and negotiating with your creditors directly. Here’s what you should know: Bruce McClary, senior vice president at the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, says that anyone at risk of delinquency should reach out as soon as possible for help from a nonprofit credit counselor, some of whom can be found through his organization . The consultation is free, and a non-judgmental counselor can give guidance towards a long-term solution. Nonprofits can also help create debt management plans that have lower interest rates, no late fees, and a single payment each month, McClary said. These plans may come with maintenance fees, which vary, but the fees are offset by the overall savings on the debt. McClary urged borrowers to be careful of scammers and for-profit debt consolidation companies, which often charge much higher fees than nonprofit organizations. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has a helpful breakdown comparing the two . Martin Lynch, president of the Financial Counseling Association of America, echoed this advice.  “Taking that first step and contacting a counselor is difficult for many people,” Lynch said. He emphasized that consumers in debt should do their best to “first, relax,” and then to be as forthcoming as possible about their circumstances with the counselor. “You’ll be talking to someone for free, who will listen to you describe your situation,” he said. “You can share your concerns without being judged for falling into difficulty.” Both Lynch and McClary urge borrowers to reach out directly to credit card companies to negotiate interest rates, fees, and long-term payment plans, noting that it’s in the companies’ best interests if you pay before the debt goes into collections. “The best thing to do is to reach out, give an honest assessment of your ability to pay over time, and ask what options are available to you both ‘on and off-the-menu,’” McClary said. This kind of phrasing can give creditors an opening to offer more flexibility, he said. McClary and other experts stress that most credit card companies and other lenders have hardship programs available for cases like these. Such options gained visibility during the COVID-19 pandemic, when more companies publicly advertised that consumers facing difficulty may skip or defer payments without penalties. The average annual interest rate on a new credit card is 24.71%, according to LendingTree, the highest since the company began tracking in 2019. That’s in part because the Federal Reserve has raised its key interest rate rate to a 23-year high to combat the highest inflation in four decades, which peaked at 9.1% in June 2022. Simultaneously, pandemic-era aid such as stimulus payments, the child tax credit, increased unemployment benefits, and a moratorium on student loan payments has ended. Wage gains haven’t all kept up with inflation, which hits lower-income consumers harder, and rent increases have eaten into savings some consumers may have built up during the early years of the pandemic. Silvio Tavares, CEO of VantageScore, a credit score modeling and analytics company, said that delinquencies have now exceeded their pre-pandemic levels, and that renters are especially vulnerable to falling behind . “Younger and less affluent people are experiencing challenges,” he said. “And high interest rates are having an effect.” Tavares said the most important thing a borrower can do is to know their credit score and keep up with payments to avoid paying additional interest on revolving balances and debt. He cautioned consumers not to over-extend themselves with “buy now, pay later” loans , which are increasingly available “at every checkout.” Credit cards only make up about 6.5% of consumer debt, according to a Bank of America Global Research report, but the increase in delinquencies appears to be outpacing income growth . According to McClary, there’s also likely a large group of consumers paying minimum balances and staying out of delinquency for now but who are too financially stressed to pay their balances in full. A worsening of the economy could push those consumers into severe delinquency, he said. On top of increasing credit card delinquencies, retail spending stalled in April. Walmart has said its customers are spending more on necessities and less on discretionary goods. Starbucks lowered its sales expectations, and McDonald’s is offering more deals as people cut back.

        "headline": "Tempted to try a no-buy year? Here are tips from people doing it",
        "date": "May 28, 2024",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — The rules of a no-buy challenge are self-imposed and simple: Make a list of the non-essential items you won’t spend money on for a set period of time and stick to it. Easier said than done. Many people start such challenges at the beginning of the year and commit to keep going until the end of it. But any time can be the right one for those looking to tackle their credit card debt, declutter their homes or to spend less time shopping. Some challenge participants begin with a no-spend month. “I commend anyone who realizes they’re just buying too much because North America is very consumer-focused and there’s too much waste,” said Carrie Rattle, the CEO of financial coaching company Behavioral Cents. Thinking of what you would be better off living without? These are some recommendations from experts and people already participating in the challenge. AP correspondent Shelley Adler reports on the ‘No Buy Year’ challenge. Whether it’s makeup, ordering takeout food or buying unnecessary trinkets in the $1 section at Target, knowing your vulnerabilities will help you make a realistic plan for staying on track. Before starting her no-buy year, Mia Westrap, a Ph.D. student in Southhampton, England, took a close look at what she spent money on during the previous few months. She decided that unnecessary food and beverages were her weakness. “I figured out that I was spending four figures on just carbonated drinks and Pepsi Max,” she said.  One of the fun parts of a no-buy challenge is that there are no set rules. Individuals choose what to include and exclude. San Diego resident Amea Wadsworth, 22, used to love spending hours looking at clothes and quirky knickknacks at Target and Goodwill. But when she moved back home after graduating college, she realized how many things she had accumulated through the years. “When I have those decluttering moments and I look through all my stuff, I was finding things that I bought and spent a lot of money on and then never ended up wearing,” Wadsworth said. For her challenge, she chose to not buy new clothing items and prioritized spending on experiences with her loved ones. Wadsworth also started her challenge by doing it month by month. Writing down the rules that fit your needs may help you stay on track. However, it’s also fine to tweak some of the rules as you move along in your experience. Finances are very connected to emotions, and emotions sometimes can make you feel like buying something you don’t need. When Wadsworth feels an impulse to get something she saw on social media or at a story, she writes it down instead of immediately purchasing the item. At the end of the month, she reviews the list and decides what, if anything, still is worth buying. “I look back and I see how many things I wrote and I’m like ’I’m glad that I didn’t buy that because I really didn’t need it,’” Wadsworth said. If you impulse buy, it might be helpful to write down the things you want to purchase and take some time to think further about the utility of the item. Between pop-up promotions and influencers swooning over new merchandise, social media can be a trigger for unnecessary shopping, according to Courtney Alev, a consumer financial advocate at Credit Karma. If you think screen time is compounding your overspending habit, Alev recommends taking a break from following accounts that bring on the urge to pull out a credit card. When Westrap began her no-buy year, she felt like the universe was conspiring against her. Her car broke down one month, and the next she received an expensive fine for an overdue parking ticket she was unaware of. Unexpected expenses or weak moments happen to everyone, and it’s OK if you don’t follow your no-buy year rules exactly as you had planned. The effort matters. “If you fail, you probably need a bit more help. You are not a failure. You have simply failed at one method,” Rattle said. “And that’s really important because I don’t want people to feel dejected.” Building a new habit and managing your finances can be difficult. Try to be gentle with yourself in the process. The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

        "date": "February 26, 2025",
        "content": "Wall Street is once again fixated on Nvidia, as the main player in the artificial intelligence mania is set to report earnings after the bell Wednesday and give an update on demand for its semiconductors, which are used to power AI applications. This will be Nvidia’s first earnings report since a Chinese upstart, DeepSeek , upended the artificial-intelligence industry by saying it has developed a large language model that can compete with big U.S. rivals without having to use the most expensive chips. Nvidia’s market value saw a one-day drop of nearly $600 billion after the news came out. Here’s a look at Nvidia, by the numbers. Nvidia’s total market value as of the close Tuesday, second in the S&P 500 behind Apple ($3.711 trillion). Microsoft is third with a market value just below $3 trillion ($2.958 trillion). Two years ago, Nvidia’s market value was below $600 billion. The one-day drop in Nvidia shares on Jan. 27 after the DeepSeek’s revelation called into question all the spending Wall Street had assumed would go into not only Nvidia’s chips but also the ecosystem that’s built around the AI boom. The stock rose more than 170% in 2024. That’s approximately how much of the S&P 500’s gain for last year could be attributed to Nvidia alone, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. By comparison, Amazon accounted for about 6% of the gain. Nvidia replaced Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in November.  Wall Street’s estimate for overall revenue in the fourth quarter. That would be up more than 70% from last year’s fourth quarter. Analysts’ estimate for Nvidia’s revenue for the fiscal year that ended in January 2025, which the company will report later Wednesday. That would be more than double its revenue for fiscal 2024 and more than four times its receipts the year before that. That’s how many dozen eggs one could buy with Nvidia’s market value of $3.101 trillion, using the average price of $4.95 per dozen for January from the Federal Reserve."

        "date": "February 26, 2025",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted to a mixed finish on Wednesday after climbing in the morning but then running out of steam. The S&P 500 finished an iota higher, less than 0.1%, after surrendering virtually all of its early gain of 0.9%. But that was just enough to break a four-day losing streak that had knocked the index off its all-time high . The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 188 points, or 0.4%, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.3%. The stock market has generally been struggling following some weaker-than-expected reports on the economy, including a couple that showed U.S. households are getting more pessimistic about inflation and tariffs pushed by President Donald Trump . Some of the harshest drops hit Big Tech and other high-growth stocks, whose incredible momentum had earlier seemed unstoppable. Super Micro Computer, one of the stocks that’s soared in the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology, lost nearly a quarter of its value over four days, for example. But it jumped 12.2% Wednesday after filing its annual report for its fiscal year that ended in June. Stocks are moving higher. More from AP’s Damian Troise. The company, which sells servers used in AI, had delayed filing its annual report and other required forms after its former accounting firm raised concerns about some of its financial reporting and governance. Super Micro then had to get extensions from Nasdaq to file the financial reports as it conducted a review and hired another public accounting firm. Much of the market’s attention remained on Nvidia , the chip company that’s become the poster child of the AI rush. It rose 3.7% ahead of its latest profit report, which arrived after trading ended for the day.  It was the first earnings report for the company and its CEO , Jensen Huang, since a Chinese upstart, DeepSeek , upended the AI industry by saying it developed a large language model that can compete with big U.S. rivals without having to use the most expensive chips. That called into question all the spending Wall Street assumed would go into not only Nvidia’s chips but also the ecosystem that’s built around the AI boom, including electricity to power large data centers. Some Big Tech companies have since said they still plan to invest billions of dollars into AI, an encouraging signal for the industry. NRG Energy jumped 10.6% Wednesday after announcing it’s joining with GE Vernova and a subsidiary of Kiewit on a venture to generate more electricity for generative AI data centers. GE Vernova rose 5.5%. NRG also reported results for the latest quarter that topped analysts’ expectations. Most of the other companies in the S&P 500 have likewise been delivering better profits for the end of 2024 than analysts expected. Off-price retailer TJX rose 1.8% after joining the parade. The company behind TJ Maxx and Marshalls additionally said it plans to increase its dividend 13% and announced a program to buy up to $2.5 billion of its stock. Worries have been rising about whether U.S. shoppers may cut back on their spending given stubbornly high inflation and jitters about the economy’s prospects. But TJX CEO Ernie Herrman said his company has benefited from its off-price model and sees opportunities to grow over the long term. General Motors revved up by 3.7% after the automaker announced a program to buy back up to $6 billion of its stock. It will also send more cash to its shareholders by increasing its dividend. On the losing end of Wall Street, Advance Auto Parts tumbled 17.8% after the retailer said it made less profit from each $1 of revenue during the latest quarter than a year earlier, in part because of liquidation sales at stores it closed. Apple, meanwhile, was the heaviest weight on the S&P 500 after dropping 2.7%. All told, the S&P 500 inched up by 0.81 to 5,956.06. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 188.04 points to 43,433.12, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 48.88 to 19,075.26. In the bond market, Treasury yields fell again after dropping sharply in recent days on worries about the U.S. economy. The yield on the 10-year Treasury sank to 4.24% from 4.30% late Tuesday. It had been nearing 4.80% just last month. On Thursday, the U.S. Commerce Department will issue its third and final estimate of how the U.S. economy performed in the final three months of 2024. The economy still appears to be in solid shape , and growth is continuing , though uncertainty is rising about the future. Another report on Friday will show how the gauge of inflation that the Federal Reserve prefers to use has been behaving. If reports were to show a stagnating economy and accelerating inflation, they could create a toxic mix that the Federal Reserve has few tools to fix. “Stagflation is the biggest risk looming over markets right now,” according to from Mark Hackett, chief market strategist at Nationwide. In stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 climbed 1.2%, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng jumped 3.3%.

        "date": "February 25, 2025",
        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. consumer confidence plummeted in February, the biggest monthly decline in more than four years, a business research group said Tuesday, with inflation seemingly stuck and a trade war under President Donald Trump seen by a growing number of Americans as inevitable. The Conference Board reported that its consumer confidence index sank this month to 98.3 from 105.3 in January. That’s far below the expectations of economists, who projected a reading of 103, according to a survey by FactSet. The seven-point drop was the biggest month-to-month decline since August of 2021. Markets on Wall Street immediately dropped. The S&P 500 fell 0.6% in midday trading, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat. The Nasdaq declined 1.1%. Respondents to the board’s survey expressed concern over inflation with a significant increase in mentions of trade and tariffs, the board said. The Conference Board’s report Tuesday said that the measure of Americans’ short-term expectations for income, business and the job market fell 9.3 points to 72.9. The Conference Board says a reading under 80 can signal a potential recession in the near future. The proportion of consumers expecting a recession over the next year jumped to a nine-month high, the board said. Consumers’ view of current conditions tumbled 3.4 points to a reading of 136.5 this month and views on current labor market conditions fell again.  “Views of current labor market conditions weakened,” the group said Tuesday. “Consumers became pessimistic about future business conditions and less optimistic about future income. Pessimism about future employment prospects worsened and reached a ten-month high.” Consumers appeared increasingly confident heading into the end of 2024 and spent generously during the holiday season. However, U.S. retail sales dropped sharply in January, with cold weather taking some of the blame for a dent in vehicle sales and at retail stores. Retail sales fell 0.9% last month from December, the Commerce Department reported last week. The decline, the biggest in a year, came after two months of healthy gains. Inflation has also remained sticky . So much so that the Federal Reserve has taken a more cautious approach to interest rates, leaving its benchmark borrowing rate alone at its last meeting after cutting it at the previous three. Fed officials have also expressed uncertainty over the new administration’s policies. The most recent economic data and a pessimistic turn among American households does not bode well for the U.S. economy, experts say. In a note to clients, Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote: “Based on all the indicators showing declining consumer and business confidence and sentiment, we are expecting a slowing economy.” The consumer confidence index measures both Americans’ assessment of current economic conditions and their outlook for the next six months. Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity and is closely watched by economists for signs about how the American consumer is feeling."

        "date": "February 25, 2025",
        "content": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — Sales of Nvidia’s artificial intelligence chip Blackwell will be top of mind when the company releases its latest financial results Wednesday, with analysts eyeing future demand amid a Chinese upstart’s claim that it can train competitive AI models using far fewer resources. Wall Street expects Nvidia to report fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of 85 cents per share on revenue of $38.08 billion, according to FactSet. The company’s net income is expected to reach $19.58 billion. What happens with Nvidia matters for the entire U.S. stock market. The chip company has grown into the second-largest company on Wall Street, which means the stock’s movement carries more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes than every company except Apple. The tech giant, based in Santa Clara, California, is now worth over $3 trillion . Nvidia and other companies benefiting from the AI boom have been a major reason the S&P 500 has climbed to record after record recently, with the latest coming last week. Their explosion of profits has helped to propel the market despite worries about stubbornly high inflation and possible pain coming for the U.S. economy from tariffs and other policies of President Donald Trump. Nvidia alone accounted for more than a fifth of all of the S&P 500 index’s total return last year. None of the other 499 companies in the index came close. If Nvidia can’t keep up its momentum, particularly when critics say its stock price has climbed too much and too quickly, Americans holding S&P 500 index funds in their 401(k) and other investing accounts could be set for pain.  The fourth-quarter earnings will be the company’s first report since Chinese company DeepSeek boasted it had developed a large language model that could compete with ChatGPT and other U.S. rivals, but was more cost-effective in its use of Nvidia chips to train the system on troves of data. The frenzy over DeepSeek caused $595 billion in Nvidia’s wealth to briefly vanish. But the company in a statement commended DeepSeek’s work as “an excellent AI advancement” that leveraged “widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant.” Nvidia had carved out an early lead in the AI applications race, partly because of founder and CEO Jensen Huang’s successful bet on the chip technology used to fuel the industry. The company is no stranger to big bets. Nvidia’s invention of the graphics processor unit, or GPU, in 1999 helped spark the growth of the PC gaming market and redefined computer graphics. Nvidia will release its quarterly earnings after the market closes Wednesday. —— Associated Press writer Stan Choe contributed to this report."

        "headline": "Stock market today: Wall Street falls as US consumers get more pessimistic about inflation, tariffs",
        "date": "February 25, 2025",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Some of Wall Street’s brightest stars lost more of their shine Tuesday after another report said U.S. households are getting more pessimistic about the economy. The S&P 500 fell 0.5% and had been down as much as 1.2% during the day. It was the fourth straight drop for the main measure of the U.S. stock market’s health after it set an all-time high last week. The Nasdaq composite sank 1.4% as several influential Big Tech companies lost momentum and screeched lower. But the majority of stocks nevertheless rose, which helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average add 159 points, or 0.4%. The U.S. stock market has been generally struggling since the middle of last week after several weaker-than-expected reports on the economy thudded onto Wall Street. On Tuesday, the latest said confidence among U.S. consumers is falling by more than economists expected. The U.S. economy still appears to be in solid shape , and growth is continuing at the moment. But for the first time since June, a measure of consumers’ expectations for the economy in the short term fell below a threshold that usually signals a recession ahead, according to The Conference Board. The increase in pessimism was broad-based and carried across both higher- and lower-income households, as well as older and younger ones. AP business correspondent Damian Troise reports the stock market is trying to move back to record highs. “There was a sharp increase in the mentions of trade and tariffs, back to a level unseen since 2019,” according to Stephanie Guichard, senior economist, global indicators at The Conference Board. “Most notably, comments on the current administration and its policies dominated the responses.”  For its part, President Donald Trump’s White House said the lower confidence reflects the overhang of his predecessor, former President Joe Biden. It also pointed to recent announcements of investment for new U.S. facilities by Apple and of improving CEO confidence as indicators of upcoming growth. Wall Street tracks confidence among consumers because solid spending by them has been helping to keep the U.S. economy out of a recession. And Tuesday’s report echoed what an earlier report from the University of Michigan suggested: Consumers see the current situation as OK, but they’re worried about the future. The pessimism hit high-momentum areas of the market in particular, those that had seen waves of euphoric investors pile in during recent years. Nvidia fell 2.8%, for example, while Tesla tumbled 8.4%. They were the two heaviest weights on the S&P 500. Bitcoin likewise sank, falling back toward $88,000, which dragged down stocks of companies in the crypto industry. MicroStrategy, the company that’s raised money in ord to buy more bitcoin and now goes by the name Strategy, fell 11.4% Zoom Communications dropped 8.5% even though it reported stronger results for the latest quarter than expected. Analysts at UBS pointed to the company’s forecast for revenue growth in the upcoming year, which fell a bit short of their own estimate. They helped offset a 2.8% rise for Home Depot, which delivered a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Decker, though, said the retailer is still contending with an uncertain economy and higher interest rates, which hems in customers’ ability to spend on home improvements. Along with Home Depot, the majority of stocks within the S&P 500 rose. Homebuilders climbed on hopes that potentially lower mortgage rates could help the industry, for example, and PulteGroup jumped 4.5%. But homebuilders and retailers are much smaller in market value than Nvidia and other Big Tech stocks, which gives them less weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes. All told, the S&P 500 fell 28.00 points to 5,995.25. The Nasdaq composite dropped 260.54 to 19,026.39, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 159.95 to 43,621.16. The pace of profit reports is slowing, but the potentially most anticipated report is still to come on Wednesday. That’s Nvidia , which has grown to become one of Wall Street’s most influential stocks because of nearly insatiable demand for its chips. Wednesday will provide the first earnings report for the company and its CEO, Jensen Huang, since a Chinese upstart, DeepSeek , upended the artificial-intelligence industry by saying it developed a large language model that can compete with big U.S. rivals without having to use the most expensive chips. That called into question all the spending Wall Street had assumed would go into not only Nvidia’s chips but also the ecosystem that’s built around the AI boom, including electricity to power large data centers. In the bond market, Treasury yields pulled back as investors herded into investments generally seen as safer when the U.S. economy’s prospects look rockier. Yields have been swinging sharply since President Donald Trump’s election amid uncertainties about how his policies on tariffs, immigration and taxes could affect the global economy. Trump has antagonized U.S. trading partners recently, threatening to raise tariffs and inviting them to retaliate with import taxes of their own. Trump said Monday that tariff hikes on imports from Canada and Mexico will move ahead after a one-month delay. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.29% from 4.40% late Monday, which is a notable move for the bond market. It’s down sharply from January, when it was approaching 4.80%, and could be an indication of growing nervousness about upcoming economic growth. In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed in Europe after falling across much of Asia. Tokyo’s Nikkei Nikkei 225 lost 1.4% after markets in Japan reopened from a holiday on Monday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4%, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.3%. A rise for Nvidia and drop for Apple helped to sway the market back and forth through the day. General Motors revved higher after saying it would send more cash to investors. Treasury yields fell again as worries about economic growth continued.

        "date": "February 24, 2025",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks drifted lower on Monday to compound their sharp losses from last week . The S&P 500 dipped 0.5% after flipping between small gains and losses several times through the day. The relatively modest moves followed its 1.7% tumble on Friday, which came after several weaker-than-expected reports on the U.S. economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 33 points, or 0.1%, while the Nasdaq composite fell 1.2%. Berkshire Hathaway climbed 4.1% for one of the market’s bigger gains after Warren Buffett’s company reported a jumped in operating profits for the latest quarter. But even there, the good news came with a bit of caution. The AP’s Damian Troise reports stocks are moving higher. The owner of Geico, BNSF railroad and other businesses said over the weekend that it’s sitting on a mountain of $334.2 billion in unused cash. Such a large amount could indicate Buffett, who’s famous for buying stocks when prices are low, may not see much worth purchasing in a market that critics say looks too expensive. Starbucks rose 1.3% after saying it would cut 1,100 corporate jobs and leave several hundred more positions unfilled as new CEO Brian Niccol tries to make it a leaner operation. Domino’s Pizza sank 1.5% after reporting results for the latest quarter that just missed analysts’ expectations. Its international operations were a standout, but a closely tracked sales trend weakened for corporate-owned U.S. stores.  Big U.S. companies have broadly been reporting better profits for the last three months of 2024 than analysts expected, which is one of the main reasons the S&P 500 set a record before sliding at the end of last week. The pace of reports will slow this week, but several potentially market-moving updates are still on deck. Chief among them is Nvidia , the company that’s become one of Wall Street’s most influential stocks because of what had been nearly insatiable demand for its chips. Wednesday will be the company’s first profit report since a Chinese upstart, DeepSeek , upended the artificial-intelligence industry by saying it developed a large language model that can compete with big U.S. rivals without having to use the top-flight, most expensive chips. That called into question all the spending Wall Street had assumed would go into not only Nvidia’s chips but also the ecosystem that’s built around the AI boom, including electricity to power large data centers. Nvidia’s stock bounced between gains and losses through Monday, helping to pull the S&P 500 and other indexes up and down in its wake. It ended up falling 3.1% and was the heaviest single weight on the S&P 500. Because of its massive size, Nvidia is the second-most influential stock on the S&P 500 after only Apple, and it alone accounted for more than a fifth of the index’s total return last year. “There is very little room for Nvidia to disappoint analyst profit expectations this year, given its assumed leadership position in AI, already elevated valuations, and new developments and entrants in the space that could threaten its dominance over time,” according to Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise. Other big profit reports due this week include Home Depot’s on Tuesday and Salesforce’s on Wednesday. All told, the S&P 500 fell 29.88 points to 5,983.25. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 33.19 to 43,461.21, and the Nasdaq composite fell 237.08 to 19,286.92. This upcoming week will also feature updates on consumer confidence and inflation, topics that are at the top of Wall Street’s agenda following last week’s slump. Recent reports have shown that consumer sentiment is souring as expectations for inflation worsen, in part because of tariffs and other policies pushed by President Donald Trump . Stubbornly high inflation could prevent the Federal Reserve from delivering more relief for the economy and financial markets through lower interest rates. The Fed has been holding its main interest rate steady after sharply cutting it through the end of last year. At their last policy meeting in January , Fed officials suggested they may stay on hold for a while given worries about how Trump’s proposed tariffs and mass deportations of migrants, along with other factors, could push upward on inflation. While lower rates can boost the economy, they can also encourage spending that puts upward pressure on inflation. In the bond market, Treasury yields eased ahead of the upcoming reports. The yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped to 4.40% from 4.43% late Friday. In stock markets abroad, German stocks ticked higher, and the DAX advanced 0.6% after political conservatives won an election dominated by concerns about Europe’s largest economy. Indexes dipped across much of the rest of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 fell 0.8%, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng slipped 0.6% and Japan’s market was closed for a holiday.

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — A sharp slide for Walmart on Thursday helped pull Wall Street off of its record. The S&P 500 slipped 0.4% for its first drop after setting all-time highs in each of the last two days . The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 450 points, or 1%, and the Nasdaq composite sank 0.5%. Walmart drove the market lower after falling 6.5%, even though the retailer reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based giant gave a forecast for upcoming profit that fell short of analysts’ expectations as shoppers across the country deal with still-high inflation and the threat of tariffs from President Donald Trump . Walmart is still forecasting growth in revenue for this upcoming year and said it has experience in navigating the effects of tariffs, but its profit outlook helped pull stocks lower across the retail industry. Costco fell 2.6%,Target dropped 2% and Amazon lost 1.7%. A slide for Walmart impacts Wall Street. More from AP’s Damian Troise. Palantir Technologies was another weight on the market. It fell 5.2% to follow its 10.1% drop from the day before, after U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said he wants to cut $50 billion in spending next year. The software company got 55% of its $2.9 billion in revenue last year from government customers. They helped offset an 8.5% jump for Baxter International, which reported better profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It credited strength for its pharmaceuticals business, as well as for its medical products and therapies.  Burger chain Shake Shack rallied 11.1% after likewise reporting a stronger profit than expected. CEO Rob Lynch said sales trends remained solid during the quarter, even though bad weather around the country and wildfires in the Los Angeles area kept some customers away. Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba saw its stock that trades in the United States climb 8.1% after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It also talked up its artificial-intelligence developments. All told, the S&P 500 fell 26.63 points to 6,117.52. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 450.94 to 44,176.65, and the Nasdaq composite sank 93.89 to 19,962.36. In the bond market, Treasury yields edged lower after a report showed more U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than economists expected. It’s an indication the pace of layoffs could be worsening, but the number still remains relatively low compared with history. A separate report said growth for manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region is still growing, but not as strongly as economists expected. Such numbers are likely to keep the Federal Reserve on hold when it comes to interest rates. Last month, the Fed refrained from cutting its main interest rate for the first time at a policy meeting since it began doing so in September . While lower rates can boost the economy and prices for investments, they can also give inflation more fuel. And Fed officials were discussing at their last meeting how Trump’s proposed tariffs and mass deportations of migrants, as well as strong consumer spending, could push inflation higher this year. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.50% from 4.54% late Wednesday. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which more closely tracks expectations for upcoming Fed moves, held steadier. It remained at 4.27%, where it was late Wednesday. Traders have been paring back their expectations for how many cuts to interest rates the Fed may deliver this year, with some predicting zero. Many are pointing the potential effects of tariffs, but much of Wall Street is also banking on their ultimate impact being smaller than they initially seemed. “Given the high political costs of elevated inflation, we continue to believe that the Trump administration will not want to jeopardize US economic growth or risk higher inflation through broad and sustained tariffs,” said Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer, Americas, at UBS Global Wealth Management. Trump has already given brief, 30-day reprieves for tariffs he had announced on Mexico and Canada to give time for more negotiations. In stock markets abroad, indexes fell across much of Europe and Asia. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 1.6% for one of the world’s larger moves after China’s central bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged, in a move it said was meant to maintain financial stability. Stocks in Shanghai edged down by less than 0.1%. AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed."

The S&P 500 rose 0.2% after setting an all-time high the day before . The Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up 71 points, or 0.2%, while the Nasdaq composite inched up by 0.1%. Microsoft was the strongest force pushing the S&P 500 upward. It rose 1.3% after saying it had developed what it calls the world’s first “quantum processing unit,” which could lead to the development of much more powerful computers. While the gain was relatively modest, Microsoft’s gargantuan size gives its stock’s movements huge sway on the S&P 500 and other indexes. A 9.7% rally for Analog Devices also helped push the market higher. The semiconductor company reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, despite what CEO Vincent Roche called a “challenging macro and geopolitical backdrop.” Elon Musk’s Tesla rose 1.8%. It climbed after another electric-vehicle company, Nikola, plunged 39.1% following its filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection . The electric truck maker said it will try to sell off its assets and wind down its business. Stocks opened in retreat. More from AP business correspondent Damian Troise. They helped offset a 21.5% tumble for Celanese, which dropped even though the chemical company reported profit for the end of 2024 that topped analysts’ expectations. CEO Scott Richardson warned that it saw “demand deterioration that gave no sign of easing” during the last three months of the year, and the company expects weakness to continue for such core markets as automotive, construction and paints.  Toll Brothers, meanwhile, fell 5.9% after the homebuilder reported a weaker profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Douglas Yearley Jr. said this spring selling season has seen healthy demand so far for homes at the higher end of the price spectrum, but “affordability constraints” are hurting sales at the lower end. A separate report on Wednesday morning said homebuilders as a group broke ground on fewer U.S. houses last month than economists expected. High mortgage rates are making it difficult for some potential homebuyers to afford a house, even though the Federal Reserve began cutting its main interest rate in September in order to make things easier for the economy. Mortgage rates have followed the trend of longer-term Treasury yields , which have remained relatively high in part because the U.S. economy has remained remarkably solid and because inflation hasn’t eased as much as hoped. Tariffs threatened by President Donald Trump , along with other policies that could put upward pressure on inflation , have also caused some sharp swings for yields in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury eased a bit Wednesday and edged down to 4.53% from 4.55% late Tuesday. It was below 3.70% as recently as September and approaching 4.80% within the past few weeks. Both the bond and the stock markets have increasingly been taking Trump’s tariffs in stride, after earlier showing much more trepidation . The hope on Wall Street is that Trump is using such threats merely as a tool to drive negotiations , and the ultimate effects won’t be as bad as they initially appeared. All told, the S&P 500 added 14.57 points to finish at 6,144.15. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 71.25 to 44,627.59, and the Nasdaq composite gained 14.99 to 20,056.25. Such calm responses, though, could of course make things worse if conditions don’t go as Wall Street expects, or if it emboldens Trump to make even more forceful actions. For its part, the Federal Reserve has already signaled it may make fewer cuts this year than earlier expected, in part because of worries that inflation will remain stubbornly above its 2% target. Cutting rates can boost the economy and juice prices for investments, but they can also give inflation more fuel. Minutes released Wednesday for the Fed’s last policy meeting in January showed officials discussed how Trump’s proposed tariffs and mass deportations of migrants, as well as strong consumer spending, could push inflation higher this year In stock markets abroad, London’s FTSE 100 fell 0.6% after a report showed U.K. inflation accelerated to a 10-month high. That could put pressure on the Bank of England, which had been cutting interest rates to invigorate its tepid economy. Indexes fell more than 1% in other European markets, including in France and Germany, after finishing mixed across Asia. South Korea’s Kospi jumped 1.7%, while Japan’s Nikkei 225 slipped 0.3%.

Meta Platforms weighed on the market after falling 2.8% It was the first drop for the parent of Facebook and Instagram since Jan. 16, and it had leaped more than 20% over that 20-day winning streak. U.S. stocks have climbed back to record heights thank in large part to stronger-than-expected profit reports, even after big disruptions recently seemed set to derail Wall Street’s long, upward trend that began in 2022.  Hanging over everything has been the threat of a punishing global trade war following President Donald Trump’s announcements of tariffs . But Wall Street has been taking such actions increasingly in stride, believing they are merely tools for negotiations and that they’ll ultimately prove to be less painful for markets and the economy than they may seem initially. Then there’s DeepSeek , the Chinese artificial-intelligence startup that said it was able to match the performance of big U.S. rivals without having to use top-of-the-line chips. That raised worries about a pullback in AI investment, which has been a central reason for the market’s stellar gains in recent years. But big U.S. companies have since said in recent weeks that they still plan to invest billions of dollars in AI, even with DeepSeek’s disruption. Such optimism has global fund managers feeling so confident that they’re piling into stocks and holding only 3.5% of their portfolios in the safety of cash, according to a survey by Bank of America. That’s the lowest since 2010, strategist Michael Hartnett said in a BofA Global Research report. Helping to support the fervor has been strong profit reports from Entergy and other big U.S. businesses. Companies in the S&P 500 are on track to deliver nearly 17% growth in their earnings per share for the final three months of 2024, compared with a year earlier. That would be the best growth since 2021, according to FactSet. Still, threats continue to hang over the stock market. Last week, two reports showed inflation unexpectedly worsened across the United States last month. Such stubborn inflation may force a halt to the Federal Reserve’s cuts to interest rates, which began in September in order to take pressure off the economy and help the job market. Traders have been paring their expectations for possible cuts to rates through 2025, with a notable number saying they foresee zero. That in turn has pushed up Treasury yields in the bond market , which typically drag downward on prices for stocks and other investments. Treasury yields rose again Tuesday, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury rising to 4.55% from 4.48% late Friday. Like the U.S. stock market, bond trading was closed Monday in observance of the Presidents Day holiday. With Treasury yields no longer helping stock prices, Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson suggests winning stocks and industries could separate themselves even if the overall market looks restrained. He points to areas of the market seeing stronger momentum for earnings, such as financial companies. All told, the S&P 500 rose 14.95 points to 6,129.58. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 10.26 to 44,556.34, and the Nasdaq composite gained 14.49 to 20,041.26. In stock markets abroad, indexes rose modestly across much of Europe and Asia.

        "content": "TOKYO (AP) — Global shares traded mixed on Monday as investors continued to watch economic data and policy moves from U.S. President Donald Trump, as both are likely to impact upcoming central bank moves. France’s CAC 40 dipped nearly 0.1% in early trading to 8,171.59, while Germany’s DAX added 0.4% to 22,560.00. Britain’s FTSE 100 edged up 0.1% to 8,742.97. U.S. markets will be closed on Monday for a holiday. In Asia, Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 rose in early trading after the Cabinet Office reported that the economy grew at a better-than-expected annual rate of 2.8% in October-December , underlined by steady exports and moderate consumption. But the benchmark quickly fell back and then recovered to be little changed, finishing up less than 0.1% at 39,174.25. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, the world’s fourth-largest economy grew 0.7% for its third straight quarter of growth. Japan marked its fourth straight year of expansion, eking out 0.1% growth last year in seasonally adjusted real gross domestic product, which measures the value of a nation’s products and services. In other regional markets, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.2% to 8,537.10. South Korea’s Kospi surged 0.8% to 2,610.42. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng reversed course, to slip less than 0.1% to 22,616.23, while the Shanghai Composite added 0.3% to 3,355.83. Markets around the world are nervously watching what upward pressure may come from tariffs that Trump has announced recently . But analysts now think Trump may ultimately avoid triggering a punishing global trade war.  His most recent tariff announcement, for example, won’t take full effect for at least several weeks. That leaves time for Washington and other countries to negotiate. The Federal Reserve’s goal, as well as that of the Bank of Japan, is to keep inflation at 2%.

        "date": "February 14, 2025",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street edged back from its all-time high on Friday, as U.S. stock indexes drifted following mixed profit reports from big companies. The S&P 500 barely budged and slipped by less than 0.1%, a day after rallying within 0.1% of its record set last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 165 points, or 0.4%, while the Nasdaq composite rose 0.4%. The S&P 500 still closed out its first winning week in the last three thanks in part to reports showing companies made even fatter profits at the end of 2024 than analysts expected. They’ve helped the market power through a range of worries centered on higher interest rates and stubborn inflation. Airbnb climbed 14.4% after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected as customers booked more nights on its platform. Wynn Resorts jumped 10.4% after likewise topping earnings expectations, thanks in part to strength for its Las Vegas operations. On the losing side of Wall Street was Applied Materials, which dropped 8.2%. The company, whose products help make semiconductor chips, displays and other tech, also reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. But it gave a forecasted range for upcoming revenue whose midpoint fell short of Wall Street’s expectations. All told, the S&P 500 slipped 0.44 to 6,114.63. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 165.35 points to 44,546.08, and the Nasdaq composite rose 81.13 to 20,026.77.  In the bond market, Treasury yields fell after a report said sales at U.S. retailers weakened by much more last month than economists expected. Bad weather, including bitingly cold temperatures in the South and devastating wildfires in California, may have helped keep shoppers away from stores and auto dealerships. The hope among investors has been for economic data to remain at a Goldilocks level, where it’s not so weak that it raises worries about a downturn but not so strong that it creates upward pressure on inflation. This past week featured a couple disappointing reports that showed inflation unexpectedly accelerated last month. Besides squeezing tighter on U.S. households’ budgets, such stubbornly high inflation is likely to keep the Federal Reserve on hold for a while when it comes to providing relief through lower interest rates . Inflation may feel more upward pressure from tariffs that President Donald Trump has announced recently . So far, though, the U.S. stock market has taken such threats in stride. The belief is that Trump is using tariffs as a tool for negotiation, and he may ultimately avoid triggering a punishing global trade war in order to prevent damage to the U.S. stock market and economy. His most recent tariff announcement, for example, won’t take full effect for at least several weeks. That leaves time for Washington and other countries to negotiate and hopefully lessen the ultimate shock. “Tariffs on Chinese goods have gone into effect,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “All of the other things that have been discussed — reciprocal tariffs, steel and aluminum tariffs, and tariffs on Canada and Mexico — haven’t actually gone into effect, yet. That opens the door the negotiations.” The market’s remarkable equanimity, of course, could be dangerous if things don’t go according to Wall Street’s expectations, or if it emboldens Trump to make even more forceful moves. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.47% from 4.54% late Thursday. It’s been swinging sharply since the Federal Reserve began cutting its main interest rate sharply from September intending to make borrowing cheaper, help the economy and boost prices for stocks, bonds and other investments. The 10-year yield has been mostly climbing since then, in the opposite direction the Fed has taken short-term rates, as the U.S. economy has remained solid and as worries built about tariffs, increasing deficits and other potential policies that could goose inflation along with economic growth. The Fed warned at the end of 2024 it may not cut rates by as much in 2025 because of worries about inflation staying stubbornly high. Its goal is to keep inflation at 2%, and lower rates can give inflation more fuel. In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed across Europe and Asia. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng surged 3.7% for one of the biggest moves. Technology stocks were particularly strong, including big rallies for video games firm Tencent, smartphone maker Xiaomi and e-commerce firm Alibaba. ___ AP Writers Matt Ott and Zen Soo contributed."

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks rallied to the brink of a record Thursday after more companies reported fatter profits than expected. Wall Street mostly yawned, again, at the latest announcement on tariffs by President Donald Trump , which may not take full effect for at least several weeks. The S&P 500 climbed 1% to pull within 0.1% of its all-time high set last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 342 points, or 0.8%, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 1.5%. MGM Resorts International leaped to one of the market’s biggest gains, 17.5%, after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It cited growth in China and said trends are looking up for its Las Vegas and North American digital businesses. Other companies reporting better profit than expected included GE HealthCare Technologies, which rose 8.8%, Molson Coors Beverage, which gained 9.5%, and Robinhood Markets, which jumped 14.1%. Such reports, along with a remarkably solid U.S. economy, have kept U.S. stocks near their records. A report on Thursday said fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, the latest signal of a firm job market. That’s even though many downward forces are weighing on stock prices. Chief among them are worries about stubbornly high inflation . A report on Thursday said inflation at the wholesale level was hotter than economists expected last month, following a similar report from the day before on inflation that U.S. consumers are feeling .  Tariffs could push up inflation even further. And Trump on Thursday rolled out his plan to increase U.S. tariffs on imports from other countries that will be customized, based in part on how much tax each country charges on U.S. goods. While economists warn about the pain such tariffs can create, financial markets have increasingly taken the threats in stride. Belief is strong that Trump is using tough talk to drive negotiations, but he may not fully go through with it in order to avoid damaging the U.S. stock market and economy. It could take weeks or a few months to complete the necessary reviews for the tariffs announced on Thursday, according to a senior White House official who insisted on anonymity to preview the details on a call with reporters. That implies plenty of time for negotiations that could ease the ultimate impact. Of course, Wall Street’s belief that the stock market is serving as a guardrail hemming in Trump may prove dangerous. If the stock market keeps gliding through each escalating threat, it could embolden Trump to make even bigger moves. But, for now at least, Trump may be “boxed in” a bit following the high inflation figures that have hit this week, according to Thierry Wizman, a strategist at Macquarie. Trump has already shown he can quickly pull back on threats , like when he put a 30-day pause on 25% tariffs he had announced for all imports from Canada and Mexico. Still, Trump followed through on a 10% tariff on Chinese products. GE HealthCare said Thursday it took those tariffs into account when it drew up its forecasts for profit and other financial measures in 2025. On Wall Street, Deere & Co. fell 2.2% after reporting drops in its revenue and profit for the latest quarter. The farm equipment manufacturer said it was focused on reducing inventory amidst the “uncertain market conditions” its customers were facing. Reddit, the online message board, dropped 5.3% even as it handily outdistanced Wall Street’s fourth quarter sales and profit targets. Cisco Systems gained 2.1% after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It cited strength for a wide range of its products, including for artificial-intelligence infrastructure. All told, the S&P 500 rose 63.10 points to 6,115.07. Its all-time high is 6,118.71, set on Jan. 23. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 342.87 to 44,711.43, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 295.69 to 19,945.64. In the bond market, Treasury yields eased. While hotter-than-expected inflation data typically sends yields higher, economists saw some encouraging nuggets underneath the surface in Thursday’s report. Easier health care services costs, for example, could end up helping to pull a different measure of inflation lower, one that the Federal Reserve considers a better measuring stick than the consumer price or producer price indexes. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.53% from 4.63%. Besides squeezing tighter on U.S. households’ budgets, stubbornly high inflation is likely to keep the Federal Reserve on hold for a while when it comes to providing relief to Americans through lower interest rates . The Fed had cut its main interest rate sharply from September through the end of last year, intending to make borrowing cheaper, help the economy and boost prices for stocks, bonds and other investments. But the Fed warned at the end of 2024 it may not cut rates by as much in 2025 because of worries about inflation staying stubbornly high.

        "date": "February 12, 2025",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Most U.S. stocks fell Wednesday after a report showed inflation is unexpectedly worsening for Americans . The S&P 500 dropped 0.3%, though it had been on track for a much worse loss of 1.1% at the start of trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 225 points, or 0.5%, while the Nasdaq composite edged higher by less than 0.1%. Stocks pared their losses through the day as the price of oil eased. A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude fell 2.7% below $72 after President Donald Trump said he had agreed with Russia’s president to begin “negotiations” on ending the war in Ukraine . Such a move could free up the global movement of crude. Still, Wall Street’s overall momentum remained downward, and the majority of stocks fell. Treasury yields also remained notably higher in the bond market, cranking up the pressure on financial markets after the morning’s report said U.S. consumers had to pay higher prices for eggs , gasoline and other costs of living than economists expected. Overall inflation was 3% for U.S. consumers in January. That was worse than the 2.9% inflation rate of December, which is what economists expected to see again. The inflation report suggested not only that pressure on U.S. households’ budgets is amplifying but also that traders on Wall Street were correct to forecast the Federal Reserve will deliver less relief for Americans through lower interest rates this year. Inflation worries have stocks lower.  The Fed had cut its main interest rate sharply from September through the end of last year, intending to make borrowing cheaper, help the economy and boost prices for stocks, bonds and other investments. But the Fed warned at the end of 2024 it may not cut rates by as much in 2025 because of worries about inflation staying stubbornly high. Its goal is to keep inflation at 2%, and lower rates can give inflation more fuel. Some investors were betting on the Fed not cutting rates at all in 2025, even before Wednesday’s report on the consumer price index, or CPI. “The hotter than expected CPI confirms investors’ anxiety regarding too-hot inflation that will keep the Fed on the sidelines,” said Sameer Samana, head of global equities and real assets at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. And January’s reading doesn’t account for any of the tariffs that Trump has recently announced , with possibly more on the way, which economists expect will raise prices for imports further. Tariffs “will make their impact felt later in the year,” Samana said. Following January’s discouraging inflation data, traders are betting on a 29% chance the Fed will not cut rates at all this year, according to data from CME Group . That’s up from a less than 20% chance seen the day before. Such expectations sent the yield on the 10-year Treasury up to 4.62% from 4.54% late Tuesday, which is a notable move for the bond market. When a 10-year Treasury, which is seen as one of the safest investments possible, is paying that much in interest, investors are less likely to pay high prices for stocks, which carry a higher risk of seeing their prices go to zero. That puts downward pressure on U.S. stock prices that critics say already look too expensive after running to repeated records last year, with the latest for the S&P 500 coming last month. One of the few ways companies have to counteract such downward pressure on their stock prices is to deliver stronger profits. Gilead Sciences did just that, and its stock rose 7.5% after the pharmaceutical company topped profit expectations for the latest quarter. It credited strength for its HIV products, among other things. CVS Health jumped 14.9% after easily topping Wall Street’s revenue and profit expectations for the latest quarter. But topping profit forecasts isn’t always enough. Ride-hailing app Lyft fell 7.9% despite reporting stronger earnings than expected. Lyft’s revenue for the final three months of 2024 fell just short of analysts’ forecasts. Homebuilders and other companies that can feel pain from mortgage rates staying higher amid a Fed on hold also weighed on the market. Home Depot fell 2.2%, Builders FirstSource sank 3.5% and Lennar dropped 2.7%. Exxon Mobil sank 3% as oil-and-gas companies fell broadly following the 2.4% drop for the price of a barrel of Brent crude, the international standard, to $75.18. Frontier Group Holdings, the parent company of Frontier Airlines, lost 4.9% after Spirit Airlines rejected a third takeover bid from the budget rival. Spirit said that it would focus on its own plan to emerge from the protection of a U.S. bankruptcy court and stabilize its finances. All told, the S&P 500 fell 16.53 points to 6,051.97. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 225.09 to 44,368.56, and the Nasdaq composite added 6.09 to 19,649.95. In stock markets abroad, indexes were mostly higher across much of Europe and Asia.

The moves were modest not only for U.S. stocks but also in the bond market , where Treasury yields rose by only a bit. The threat of a possible trade war is very real, of course, with high potential stakes. Most of Wall Street agrees that substantial and sustained tariffs would push up prices for U.S. households and ultimately lead to big pain for financial markets around the world . The European Union’s chief , Ursula von der Leyen, said on Tuesday that “unjustified tariffs on the EU will not go unanswered — they will trigger firm and proportionate countermeasures.” But trading remained mostly calm in part because Trump has shown he can be quick to pull back on such threats . That’s what he did earlier with 25% tariffs he had announced for all imports from Canada and Mexico, suggesting tariffs may be merely a negotiating chip rather than a true long-term policy. That in turn has much of Wall Street hoping the worst-case scenario may not happen. “The metal tariffs may serve as negotiating leverage,” according to Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer, Americas, at UBS Global Wealth Management.  In the meantime, much of Wall Street’s focus on Tuesday swung to a different part of Washington. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said again in testimony on Capitol Hill that the Fed is in no hurry to ease interest rates any further. The Fed had cut its main interest rate sharply through the end of last year, hoping to give a boost to the economy. But worries about inflation potentially staying stubbornly high have forced the Fed and traders alike to cut back expectations for cuts in 2025. Some traders are even betting on the possibility of zero, in part because of worries about the effects of tariffs. “We’re in a pretty good place,” Powell said about where the economy and interest rates are currently. He said again he’s aware that going too slowly on rate cuts could damage the economy, while moving too quickly could push inflation higher. Higher rates tend to put downward pressure on prices for stocks and other investments, while pressuring the economy by making borrowing more expensive. That could be risky for a U.S. stock market that critics say already looks too expensive. The S&P 500 is not far from its all-time high set late last month. One way companies can offset such downward pressure on their stock prices is to deliver stronger profits. And big U.S. companies have been mostly doing just that recently, as they report how much profit they made during the last three months of 2024. That, though, hasn’t always been enough. Marriott International fell 5.4% even though it reported a better profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Investors focused instead on its forecasted range for an important underlying measure of profit this upcoming year, which fell short of what analysts were expecting. Humana sank 3.5% despite reporting a milder loss than analysts expected. The insurer and health care company offered a forecast for profit in 2025 that fell short of Wall Street’s expectations. Helping to offset such losses was Coca-Cola, which rallied 4.7% after reporting stronger profit and revenue than analysts expected. Growth in China, Brazil and the United States helped lead the way. DuPont climbed 6.8% after the chemical company likewise reported better profit than Wall Street expected. All told, the S&P 500 rose 2.06 points to 6,068.50. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 123.24 to 44,593.65, and the Nasdaq composite fell 70.41 to 19,643.86. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.53% from 4.50% late Monday. The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more closely with expectations for upcoming action by the Fed, held steady. It remained at 4.28%, where it was late Monday. In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed across Europe and Asia. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 1.1%, and South Korea’s Kospi rose 0.7% for some of the bigger moves, while Japanese markets were closed for a national holiday. ___ AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Zen Soo contributed."

        "date": "February 10, 2025",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks rose Monday as Wall Street took President Donald Trump’s latest threat on tariffs in stride. The S&P 500 climbed 0.7%, coming off a losing week that was bookended by worries about how potential tariffs could push up inflation and threaten the economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 167 points, or 0.4%, and the Nasdaq composite rallied 1% as Nvidia and other Big Tech stocks led the way. The bond market also remained relatively firm, with Treasury yields making only modest moves after Trump said over the weekend that he would announce 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, as well as other import duties later in the week. Fear around tariffs has been at the center of Wall Street’s moves recently, and experts say the market likely has more swings ahead. The price of gold, which often rises when investors are feeling nervous, climbed again Monday to top $2,930 per ounce and set another record. But Trump has shown he can be just as quick to pull back on threats , like he did with 25% tariffs he had announced on Canada and Mexico, suggesting they may be merely a negotiating chip rather than a true long-term policy. Tariff threats aren’t taking a toll on stocks. Trump, of course, has already gone ahead with 10% tariffs on China. Those will likely affect Wall Street by cleaving winning industries from losing ones, but they won’t necessarily drag the entire market lower, according to Michael Wilson and other strategists at Morgan Stanley. A big, market-wide impact would be more likely “if we were to see sustained tariffs on a range of countries including 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada.” Stocks of U.S. steel and aluminum producers jumped Monday, banking on expectations tariffs could help their profits, while the overall S&P 500 index remained relatively calm.  Nucor rose 5.6%, Cleveland-Cliffs jumped 17.9% and Alcoa climbed 2.2%. Some companies that have to buy steel in their manufacturing swung, but not so sharply. General Motors fell 1.7%, Caterpillar slipped 0.2% and Ford Motor was flat. In the meantime, earnings reports from big U.S. companies also helped drive trading. McDonald’s climbed 4.8% even though it reported profit and revenue for the end of 2024 that were just shy of analysts’ expectations. Investors focused instead on better-than-expected strength for restaurants outside the United States, particularly in the Middle East, Japan and other markets with licensed McDonald’s locations. Big Tech stocks were some of the strongest forces pushing the S&P 500 higher, including gains of 2.9% for Nvidia and 4.5% for Broadcom. They had come under pressure last month after a Chinese upstart upended Wall Street’s artificial-intelligence boom by saying it had developed a large language model that could perform like the world’s best without having to use the most expensive, top-flight chips. Despite the development by DeepSeek, big U.S. companies have since said they’re still planning to plow billions of dollars into their AI endeavors . That’s calmed worries that DeepSeek could have turned off a huge spigot of spending for the industry, at least for now. Such gains helped offset a 7.9% drop for Incyte after the biopharmaceutical company reported weaker profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. All told, the S&P 500 rose 40.45 points to 6,066.44. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 167.01 to 44,4701.41, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 190.87 to 19,714.27. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury held steady at 4.50%, where it was late Friday. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which more closely tracks expectations for what the Federal Reserve will do with short-term interest rates, fell to 4.27% from 4.29%. The Fed cut its main interest rate several times through the end of last year, but traders have been sharply curtailing their expectations for more reductions in 2025, in part because of fears about potentially higher inflation from tariffs. While lower rates can give a boost to the economy and investment prices, they can also give inflation more fuel. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will be offering testimony before Congress later this week, where he could offer more hints about what the Fed is thinking. In December, Fed officials sent financial markets sharply lower after indicating they may cut rates only twice this year. Now, some traders and economists think the Fed may not cut at all. Reports are also coming this week on inflation, which could further drive the Fed’s actions. On Wednesday, economists expect a report to show prices for eggs, gasoline and other living costs for U.S. consumers were overall 2.9% higher in January than a year earlier. In stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 was virtually unchanged after Japan’s government reported a record current account surplus last year.

        "headline": "Race to sell chickens after New York City live poultry markets ordered shut due to avian flu",
        "date": "February 07, 2025",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Live poultry markets in New York City raced to sell off all their chickens and other fowl Friday after seven cases of avian flu were detected and state officials ordered markets in the metropolitan area to close for a week. Gov. Kathy Hochul said there was no immediate threat to public health and that the temporary closure of bird markets in the city and its Westchester County and Long Island suburbs came out of an abundance of caution. Avian flu has hit farms nationwide, led to the slaughter of millions of birds and driven up egg prices, though officials say no cases have been detected among humans in New York. The state order came after birds infected with the virus were found during routine inspections of live bird markets in the New York City boroughs of the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens. Those markets have to dispose of all poultry in a sanitary manner, according to the state’s order. Other bird markets that do not have cases will have to sell off remaining poultry within three days, clean and disinfect and then remain closed for at least five days and be inspected by state officials before reopening. That meant employees at La Granja, a halal-certified poultry market in Manhattan’s Harlem neighborhood, were rushing to sell the remainder of its inventory: around 200 live chickens of different varieties, along with turkeys, quail, ducks, roosters, pigeons and rabbits.  Any remaining animals would be slaughtered and given away to employees and longtime customers, according to Jose Fernandez, the owner. “We’re going to lose money, for now,” he said. “But the law is the law. They know what they’re doing.” The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said the virus poses low risk to the general public. The agency said there have been 67 confirmed cases of bird flu in humans in the U.S., with illnesses mild and mostly detected among farmworkers who were exposed to sick poultry or dairy cows. Despite growing attention on the avian flu, New York City’s poultry markets appeared to be doing brisk business Friday. Outside the Wallabout Poultry market in Brooklyn, a line of customers took numbers and picked their chickens, which employees snatched from crowded cages, weighing them upside down, before bringing them to a backroom to be slaughtered. “I’m not worried about any bird flu,” said Stan Tara, a 42-year-old Brooklyn resident, as he purchased a large chicken for $22.50. “It’s the same as you buy from the supermarket. A little more expensive, but at least it’s fresh.” The first bird flu death in the U.S . was reported last month in Louisiana, with health officials saying the person was older than 65, had underlying medical problems and had been in contact with sick and dead birds in a backyard flock. The H5N1 strain of bird flu has been spreading among wild birds, poultry, cows and other animals. Officials have urged people who come into contact with sick or dead birds to wear respiratory and eye protection and gloves when handling poultry. More than 156 million birds nationwide have been affected by the outbreak, many at large farming operations that have had to slaughter their entire flocks. Some animal rights groups, meanwhile, questioned the purpose of a state order that allowed the markets to continue selling fowl, rather than shutting them down immediately. “The public is going into markets where no one knows if there are outbreaks of avian flu, then taking home dead birds that may or may not be infected,” said Edita Birnkrant, executive director of NYCLASS, which has long raised alarms about conditions within the city’s roughly 70 live animal markets. “It’s ludicrous.” U.S. egg prices are likely to remain high past Easter and well into 2025, largely because of avian flu, according to CoBank, a Denver-based provider of loans and other financial services to the agriculture sector. The highly contagious virus has affected nearly 100 million egg-laying hens in the U.S. since 2022. But CoBank said other factors are also causing supply constraints and driving up prices, such as skyrocketing consumer demand for eggs in recent years. Fast-growing breakfast and brunch chains like First Watch are also eating up supplies.

        "date": "February 07, 2025",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks slumped Friday as worries flared again on Wall Street about tariffs and inflation . The S&P 500 fell 0.9% and erased what had been a modest gain for the week. It’s one of the worse drops for the index so far in the young year, but it remains near its record set two weeks ago . The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 444 points, or 1%, and a sharp fall for Amazon after its latest profit report dragged the Nasdaq composite to a market-leading loss of 1.4%. Treasury yields also climbed in the bond market after a discouraging report on Friday morning suggested sentiment is unexpectedly souring among U.S. consumers. The preliminary report from the University of Michigan said U.S. consumers are expecting inflation in the year ahead to hit 4.3%, the highest such forecast since 2023. That’s a full percentage point above what consumers said they were expecting a month earlier, and it’s the second straight increase of an unusual amount. Economists pointed to the possibility of U.S. tariffs on a wide range of imported products, which President Donald Trump has proposed and could ultimately push up prices for U.S. consumers. Trump said at a White House press conference Friday that he’s likely to have an announcement on Monday or Tuesday on “reciprocal tariffs, where a country pays so much or charges us so much, and we do the same.” The consumer-sentiment data followed a mixed update on the U.S. job market , which is often each month’s most anticipated economic report. It showed hiring last month was less than half of December’s rate , but it also included encouraging nuggets for workers: The unemployment rate eased, and workers saw bigger gains in average wages than economists expected.  All the data taken together could keep the Federal Reserve on hold when it comes to interest rates. The Fed began cutting its main interest rate in September in order to relax the pressure on the economy and job market, but it warned at the end of the year that it may cut fewer times in 2025 than it earlier expected given worries about inflation staying stubbornly high. Interest rates are one of the things Wall Street cares most about because lower rates can lead to higher prices for stocks and other investments. The downside is they can also give inflation more fuel. For Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, the jobs report did nothing to change his forecast for the Fed to cut the federal funds rate just once in 2025. That’s a touch more conservative than many traders on Wall Street, who collectively see a 45% chance the Fed will cut at least twice, according to data from CME Group . Of course, some traders are also betting on the possibility for zero cuts. Wren said financial markets could stay shaky in the near term, not only because of uncertainty about interest rates but also about Trump’s tariffs and other unknowns around the world. After rocking financial markets at the start of this week, worries about a potentially punishing global trade war had eased a bit after Trump gave 30-day reprieves for tariffs on both Mexico and Canada . In the meantime, stocks of big U.S. companies continue to swing as they report how much profit they made during the last three months of 2024. Most are reporting better results than expected, which is typical, but that’s not always enough. Amazon, one of Wall Street’s most influential companies, topped analysts’ expectations for earnings at the end of 2024, but its stock nevertheless fell 4.1%. Investors focused instead on its forecast for upcoming revenue, which fell short of analysts’ expectations. Homebuilders also tumbled to sharp losses as fewer cuts to interest rates by the Fed could help keep mortgage rates high. D.R. Horton fell 5%, and Lennar sank 4.2%. On the winning side of Wall Street was Expedia Group, which leaped 17.3% after reporting better profit for the last three months of 2024 than analysts had forecast. Expedia CEO Ariane Gorin said demand for travel during the latest quarter was stronger than expected, and the company is also bringing back its dividend for investors. It had suspended its payouts to shareholders in 2020 after the COVID-19 pandemic crushed the travel industry. All told, the S&P 500 fell 57.58 points to 6,025.99. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 444.23 to 44,303.40, and the Nasdaq composite sank 268.59 to 19,523.40. In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury yield rose to 4.48% from 4.44% late Thursday. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, rose more. It climbed to 4.28% from 4.22%. A fear among economists is that when U.S. households expect inflation to be high in the future, they could begin buying things in advance and making other moves that can leadto a self-fulfilling cycle that worsens inflation. That could push the Fed to keep the federal funds rate higher than it otherwise would. In stock markets abroad, indexes fell modestly across Europe after finishing mixed in Asia.

        "date": "February 06, 2025",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street drifted through mixed trading Thursday as rising fashion and cigarette stocks worked against drops for Ford Motor and Qualcomm. The S&P 500 rose 0.4% following healthy gains for stock markets across much of Europe and Asia. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 125 points, or 0.3%, and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.5%. Tapestry, the company behind the Coach and Kate Spade brands, helped lead the market and jumped 12%. It reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected after attracting new, younger customers. Tapestry also raised its forecast for revenue and profit growth this fiscal year. Philip Morris International, which sells Marlboro cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products around the world, was one of the strongest forces pushing upward on the S&P 500 and rallied 10.9% after reporting a better profit than expected. It also gave financial forecasts that topped expectations, and analysts pointed in particular to strength for its Zyn nicotine pouches. The AP’s Seth Sutel reports markets are looking for direction. They helped offset a 7.5% drop for Ford Motor, which fell even though the automaker delivered a stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Investors focused instead on Ford’s financial forecasts for 2025, which the company said incorporates “headwinds related to market factors.” The company gave a forecasted range for how much cash it will generate this year whose midpoint fell below analysts’ expectations, for example.  Qualcomm also kept indexes in check after falling 3.7%. The company, whose products help power smartphones and other devices, reported profit for the latest quarter that topped analysts’ forecasts, and analysts called the performance solid. But they also said expectations were high, and worries are rising about the wireless chip industry broadly. In the bond market, Treasury yields held relatively steady after a report said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week than expected, though the number remains low compared with history. A more comprehensive report will arrive on Friday, showing how many jobs U.S. employers added during the month of January. The hope is Friday’s data will show a job market that remains solid enough to keep worries about a possible downturn at bay but not so strong that it pushes upward on inflation. The U.S. economy has remained much more solid than critics feared, but pressure is rising in part because of the threat of potential tariffs coming from President Donald Trump . After rocking financial markets around the world at the start of this week, worries about a potentially punishing global trade war have eased a bit after Trump gave 30-day reprieves for tariffs on both Mexico and Canada . While discussing Ford Motor’s earnings and financial forecasts, CEO Jim Farley said his company can manage a “few weeks” of tariffs of 25% on Canadian and Mexican imports. But if they’re protracted, they would have “a huge impact on our industry,” resulting in higher prices for customers, losses of U.S. jobs and the elimination of billions of dollars of industry profits. Elsewhere on Wall Street, another company reliant on spending by consumers around the world, Ralph Lauren, rallied 9.7% after reporting stronger profit and revenue than expected. Growth was particularly strong in China, where the company recently opened stores in Hong Kong and Beijing. Eli Lilly rose 3.3% after the drugmaker showed how demand for its hot-selling diabetes and obesity treatments is swelling its profits. Specialist Dilip Patel works at his post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Tuesday, Feb. 4, 2025. (AP Photo/Richard Drew)  Honeywell fell 5.6% and was one of the heaviest weights on the S&P 500. It announced it will split into three independent , publicly-traded companies, following in the footsteps of other conglomerates such as General Electric . The North Carolina company, one of the few U.S. conglomerates still in existence, expects to complete the spin-off of its automation and aerospace technologies businesses sometime in late 2026. All told, the S&P 500 rose 22.09 points to 6,083.57. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 125.65 to 44,747.63, and the Nasdaq composite rose 99.66 to 19,791.99. In stock markets abroad, London’s FTSE 100 jumped 1.2% after the Bank of England cut its main interest rate as it slashed its forecast for economic growth. The British economy has barely grown over the past six months, and the Bank of England halved its growth projection for the British economy this year to 0.75%. Stock indexes also rose 1.5% in Paris, 1.4% in Hong Kong and 0.6% in Tokyo. In Japan, Honda Motor Co. fell, and Nissan Motor Corp. rose after Japanese media said they were ditching their talks to set up a joint holding company. Neither company confirmed the report. An update on the talks is expected by mid-February, but no date has been set. The yield on the 10-year Treasury held steady at 4.43%, where it was late Wednesday.

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street drifted higher Wednesday as gains for most stocks outweighed drops for Alphabet and some other big-name companies following their latest profit reports. The S&P 500 rose 0.4% following mixed trading across European and Asian markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 317 points, or 0.7%, and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.2%. Toymaker Mattel jumped 15.3% after blowing past analysts’ forecasts for profit in the latest quarter. Strength for its Hot Wheels brand helped make up for some softness for Barbie and other dolls. Mattel also gave a forecast for profit this upcoming year that topped analysts’ expectations. Amgen rallied 6.5% and was one of the strongest forces pushing upward on the S&P 500. It reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than expected, thanks in part to growth for its Repatha medicine, which can lower bad cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart attack. They helped offset a 7.3% drop for Alphabet, which sank even though Google’s parent company reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Investors focused instead on slowing growth for its cloud business, whose revenue fell short of forecasts. They also homed in on the $75 billion Alphabet is budgeting for investments this year, roughly $15 billion more than analysts expected, as it remains in the rush to develop artificial-intelligence technology . AP business correspondent Seth Sutel reports tech stocks are in the spotlight on Wall Street. Advanced Micro Devices fell 6.3% even though the chip company edged past profit expectations for the latest quarter. While analysts called AMD’s results solid, they also asked why CEO Lisa Su did not give more detail about expectations for the performance of its AI offerings specifically.  Investors always want companies to deliver bigger profits, but the hopes may be even higher than usual given worries about how much faster stock prices have climbed than corporate profits, causing critics to call them expensive. Uncertainty is also hanging over the global economy because of President Donald Trump’s tariffs . After rocking financial markets around the world at the start of this week, worries about a potentially punishing global trade war have eased a bit after Trump gave 30-day reprieves for tariffs on both Mexico and Canada . That bolstered traders’ hopes that Trump sees tariffs as merely a tool for negotiation, rather than as a long-term policy. Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says a further extension may happen, but he sees the tariff risk for both countries likely remaining until the end of a review of the United States’ existing trade agreement with the two countries, which could be in the middle of next year. In the meantime, Trump has pressed ahead with tariffs on Chinese goods, and Mericle expects tariffs to hit autos from the European Union, among other potential moves. That could drive a one-time boost to inflation, which could leave a widely followed measure of underlying inflation trends at 2.6% in December, above the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%. One of the fears hurting Wall Street is that the upward pressure on inflation could keep the Fed from cutting interest rates this year, after it began doing so in September in order to relax pressure on the economy and give the job market some help. Yields in the bond market fell Wednesday after a report said growth for mining, finance and other U.S. services businesses was weaker last month than economists expected. The survey by the Institute for Supply Management found many businesses citing poor weather conditions. Businesses also “mentioned preparations or concerns related to potential U.S. government tariff actions; however, there was little mention of current business impacts as a result,” according to Steve Miller, chair of the ISM’s Services Business Survey Committee. The yield on the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 4.42% from 4.52% late Tuesday. On Wall Street, the Walt Disney Company swung from an early gain to a loss of 2.4% after delivering a better profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, thanks in part to a strong performance for its “ Moana 2 ″ movie. All told, the S&P 500 rose 23.60 points to 6,061.48. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 317.24 to 44,873.28, and the Nasdaq composite added 38.31 to 19,692.33. MicroStrategy, the company that’s been raising cash with the express purpose of buying bitcoin, fell 2.2% ahead of its earnings report, which arrived after trading ended for the day. It also announced a name change to Strategy as part of a simplification of its brand to highlight its status as what it calls a “Bitcoin Treasury Company.” In stock markets abroad, European indexes were mixed amid relatively modest movements. In Asia, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 0.9%, while South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.1%. Japan’s Nikkei 225 edged up 0.1% as Honda Motor Co. jumped after Japanese media reports said its talks to set up a joint holding company with rival Nissan Motor Corp. were unraveling. Nissan’s stock fell 4.9%. AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed."
