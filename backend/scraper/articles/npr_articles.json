        "headline": "Jeff Bezos' revamp of 'Washington Post' opinions leads editor to quit",
        "date": "2025-02-26",
        "content": "The Washington Post 's billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos, announced a sweeping new libertarian vision for the paper's opinion sections on Wednesday, just four months after his decision to kill a presidential endorsement of Kamala Harris triggered hundreds of thousands of subscribers to cancel. Post Opinions Editor David Shipley, whom Bezos recruited from Bloomberg Opinions in 2022, chose to resign rather than stay to oversee the paper's revamped sections. \"We are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets,\" Bezos wrote in a memo to staffers announcing the changes. \"We'll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.\" Newspaper op-ed sections have incorporated opposing views for years. The term \"op-ed\" is literally an abbreviation for pieces running \"opposite the editorial pages\" that often conflicted with a publisher's editorial line. But Bezos characterized that practice as outdated. \"There was a time when a newspaper, especially one that was a local monopoly, might have seen it as a service to bring to the reader's doorstep every morning a broad-based opinion section that sought to cover all views,\" Bezos said. \"Today, the internet does that job.\" At an hour-long meeting with opinion writers, Shipley said he did not know what lay ahead, according to an attendee who spoke on condition of anonymity because they did not have permission to speak publicly. Shipley said he had wanted a \"broader, pluralistic place,\" but that Bezos sought \"a focused [opinion] report.\" Bezos justified his decision in the memo to staffers. \"I am of America and for America, and proud to be so,\" he wrote. \"And a big part of America's success has been freedom in the economic realm and everywhere else.\" The decision sparked fresh shock and dismay at the paper. After senior news editors raised concerns at a meeting Wednesday, Executive Editor Matt Murray reassured them that Bezos had given no indication that he wanted to interfere with news coverage, according to two people with direct knowledge. A spokesperson for the Post confirmed his remarks. Later in the day, Murray sent a memo to the newsroom to underscore the point: \"The independent and unbiased work of The Post's newsroom remains unchanged, and we will continue to pursue engaging impactful journalism without fear or favor.\" (Murray and Bezos did not reply to requests for comment.) Post Associate Editor David Maraniss, a legendary journalist whose association with the newspaper stretches back more than four decades, wrote on Bluesky that he would never write for it again as long as Bezos owns it. \"One pernicious step after another, Bezos encroached on the Post editorial policy,\" Maraniss wrote. \"Today he seized it fully. The old Washington Post is gone.\" One writer for the opinions section told NPR he was \"heartsick,\" adding, \"leadership matters.\" NPR spoke to six people with direct knowledge of events for this article. They were given the ability to speak anonymously because they were not authorized to speak about internal matters at the paper. Shipley did not respond to requests for comment. According to a person with direct knowledge, Shipley told Bezos that the new approach would violate the Post 's promise of holding power to account. Bezos stood by the newspaper's dogged reporting on the first Trump administration. In that period, the Post adopted the motto \"Democracy Dies in Darkness.\" It won Pulitzer Prizes for coverage of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and, earlier, of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. More recently, Bezos' decision in October to kill the Harris editorial sparked a furor inside and outside the paper, leading editorial writers to resign and more than 300,000 people to cancel their digital subscriptions in a matter of days. (The Post says it has been able to win some subscribers back and garner some new subscribers in the opening weeks of Trump's second term.) As a practical matter, Shipley argued to Bezos, the Wall Street Journal 's highly pro-markets pages have had a similar policy for decades. As with the decision not to publish the endorsement of Harris, Shipley's arguments fell on deaf ears. In his memo to staff, Bezos praised Shipley and wrote that he offered the editor the chance to lead the reformed sections. \"I suggested to him if the answer wasn't 'hell yes,' then it had to be 'no,'\" Bezos wrote. The Post has aggressively covered the new administration. But Bezos appears to have embraced the president's return to power. Bezos personally paid $1 million toward Trump's inaugural fund. He and his fiancée Lauren Sánchez traveled to Trump's Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, to socialize with the Trumps. And, along with other digital chieftains, Bezos sat behind the president as he was sworn in for a second term. Shipley's two-and-a-half years have brought acclaim for the section, with two Pulitzer Prizes and two Loeb Awards. But his standing was deeply undercut by Bezos's recent decisions, especially over the Harris endorsement. When Shipley decided to withhold a cartoon from the Pulitzer-winning staffer Ann Telnaes about Bezos from publication, he told colleagues he believed he was making a decision on the merits, not pulling his punches. The cartoon depicted Bezos abasing himself along with other tech titans before Trump. \"Not every editorial judgment is a reflection of a malign force,\" Shipley said in a statement shared at the time with NPR. \"My decision was guided by the fact that we had just published a column on the same topic as the cartoon and had already scheduled another column — this one a satire — for publication. The only bias was against repetition.\" Shipley told colleagues privately that he understood, given the moment, it might be hard to credit his actual motivations. The paper has bled veteran talent from both the opinion and news sides since the news broke about the killed editorial. Post journalists left for the Atlantic , the New York Times , the Wall Street Journal , and CNN among other outlets. But Post Publisher and Chief Executive Will Lewis celebrated the change in direction on Wednesday. Lewis previously served for six years in the same role at the Journal , which is owned by Trump ally and conservative media magnate Rupert Murdoch. He has advocated for a similar approach at the Post . Bezos hired Lewis, in significant part, due to his belief the British journalist could build better bridges to Trump and to conservatives. As well as serving Murdoch as an executive for a decade, Lewis was previously editor of the conservative Telegraph in the U.K. and later served as a consultant for Tory Prime Minister Boris Johnson. \"I am very excited about this new clarity and transparency, and cannot wait to see it brought to life in our opinion section. Every Day,\" Lewis said in a note to staff. \"This is not about siding with any political party. This is about being crystal clear about what we stand for as a newspaper. Doing this is a critical part of serving as a premier news publication across America and for all Americans.\""

        "headline": "Duolingo's owl mascot is alive after all. What did it gain from faking his death?",
        "date": "2025-02-26",
        "content": "Call it a miracle, or a marketing ploy: Duo the owl is back from the dead. Two weeks after announcing the murder of its sassy green mascot, the language-learning platform Duolingo now says he's fine — and that he orchestrated the entire thing. \"Faking my death was the test and you all passed,\" it captioned a video posted to social media on Monday, with a montage suggesting that users brought him back by completing their daily language lessons. y’all really think i’d let a cybertruck take me out? #duolingohasrisen pic.twitter.com/ndGA4F9kGB Duo — full name Duo Keyshauna Renee Lingo, born 1000 B.C., according to one official death announcement — has been the face of the company since its launch in 2011. His extremely insistent — sometimes threateningly-so — lesson reminders and snarky social media presence have made him an online sensation in recent years, whether he's hopping on the latest viral choreography, beefing with Duolingo's legal team or pining after pop star Dua Lipa. Duo's intrigue reached entirely new heights earlier this month after the company announced his death on Feb. 11 and said authorities were investigating the cause. \"He probably died waiting for you to do your lesson, but what do we know,\" it wrote. It released a series of mournful and mysterious social media posts in the days that followed, including videos of Duo being fatally hit by a Tesla cybertruck and other Duolingo mascots giving him a funeral — and then them being killed off, too. Then came the hopeful messages, encouraging users to complete daily lessons and quests in the app to \"bring Duo back.\" As fans — including dozens of companies and brands — paid tribute to Duo, many started to wonder if his death would end up being short-lived. \"Killing the owl off is a big move to get attention,\" Matt Williams, a visiting clinical professor at the Mason School of Business at the College of William & Mary, told NPR earlier this month. \"Smart money says he's going to get resurrected in some way.\" The question was, how — and when — would that happen? On Feb. 17, the company directed users to a website called bringback.duolingo.com, showing a goal of 50 billion XP, or \"experience points,\" which users earn every time they complete a task in the app. Exactly a week later, Duo returned. It started with a video of his resurrection : Duo (or at least a person disguised as him) climbs out of the coffin in which he had been laid to rest just weeks earlier, hops out of a truck bed and walks down the street as if nothing has happened. \"Y'all really think i'd let a cybertruck take me out? #duolingohasrisen,\" reads the caption. The second video pairs flashes of animation with upbeat rap music. It appears to show Duo growing in an egg as users rack up XP points, then hatching with purple wings and celebrating alongside other revived characters. The bring back Duolingo website shows that users around the world collectively earned 50,921,342,438 XP points. The U.S. brought in the most, 6.18 billion, followed by Germany, Brazil and China, according to a ranking on the website, which now reads: \"Duo is saved!\" On Tuesday, Duo finally pulled back the curtain on his fake and untimely demise, in a video that opens with him unzipping and crawling out of his own coffin on a sunny beach. It was all by design because I’m a mastermind pic.twitter.com/DdVigBjyMj \"I've always had two main goals: get people to do their lesson and get Dua Lipa to notice me,\" he says. \"Neither was working. I had to do something drastic. So I thought, why not kill one green bird with two stones?\" The narrator explains that while he has accumulated many enemies over the years, he figured it would be easiest to frame a software engineer named Jimmy. \"Now I know the death video looked incredibly realistic, but it was all edited,\" he admits. \"The cybertruck was mainly there for dramatic effect, and perhaps some social commentary .\" He went on to say his friends — fellow Duolingo characters, which include several humans and a bear — were being asked too many questions and were \"too nice to lie,\" so he made them fake their deaths, too. He also admits to wanting to see \"how many of you would bother to bring me back to life.\" The campaign was a success, he says, because it revealed \"who the real ones were\" and, \"most importantly,\" got Dua Lipa (who publicly mourned the owl) to notice him. \"I guess you could say I put the 'fun' in 'funeral,' \" he concludes, as the video shows him lounging on a beach chair with a drink in hand, and skipping carefree-ly across the sand. \"So yeah, please just do your lesson. Because next time it won't be a fake death.\" Social media reactions to Duo's resurrection and confession were mixed . Many commenters cheered his return, while others wondered what it was all for. Duolingo did not respond to NPR's request for comment. Williams — the former CEO of the Martin Agency, whose creations include the GEICO Gecko — told NPR earlier this month that a lot was riding on how the company chose to bring Duo back. He warned that if the storyline felt too goofy, or inconsistent with Duo's personality, it might alienate some fans — as was the case with Planters when it killed off Mr. Peanut only to reincarnate him as Baby Nut in a 2020 Super Bowl ad. On Wednesday, after watching the saga play out, Williams told NPR he sees Duolingo's campaign as a success. \"By using the Owl's resurrection as an incentive for more users to do their lessons, Duolingo spiked engagement with their product (obviously an important business metric),\" he told NPR over email. \"And they did it in a way that's completely consistent with the Owl's character — after all, the Owl's entire persona was about cajoling users to do their lessons. That's a win for the business and the brand.\" Duo has answered some questions but also raised new ones. For instance, Williams wonders where the story will go next, and how long Duolingo will be able to keep the momentum, especially given most peoples' short attention spans. For now, who — as an owl might say — knows?"

        "headline": "A pattern emerges in Elon Musk's federal shakeup: 'Break first, ask questions later'",
        "date": "2025-02-26",
        "content": "Stability used to be a hallmark of working for the federal government. Since Jan. 20, it's been quite the opposite. As President Trump acts on his campaign promise to dismantle government bureaucracy and root out waste and fraud, federal workers have complained of mass chaos and confusion while lawsuits challenging the Trump administration's moves pile up. Five weeks in, there's an emerging pattern in how the administration moves to target federal employees, and it looks something like this: This process occurred with both the \"Fork in the Road\" resignation offer, which mirrored an offer Musk made to employees at Twitter in 2022, and the \"What did you do last week?\" email, a question Musk also put to then-Twitter's CEO before buying the company in 2022. \"It's been very eerie watching what's been happening … where he rolls out the same Twitter playbook now with the federal government,\" Shannon Liss-Riordan, an attorney who has sued Musk on behalf of Twitter employees, told NPR after the \"Fork\" offer went out . Both directives were sent from the email address hr@opm.gov, which didn't exist before Jan. 20. Lawsuits are challenging whether OPM even has the authority to send such communications. Meanwhile, Trump has cheered Musk's work and encouraged him to go further. \"Elon is doing a great job, but I would like to see him get more aggressive,\" Trump wrote on his social media site Truth Social. The president's words ignore the fact that Musk himself has no authority to tell federal agencies what to do. In a court filing earlier this month, the White House stated that Musk is a \"Senior Advisor to the President,\" and like other senior advisers, \"has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself.\" Still, that doesn't mean Musk — with the ear of the president and a giant megaphone — lacks power. When Musk posted on his social media site X that federal employees could lose their jobs if they didn't respond to the \"What did you do last week?\" email, that threat became part of the narrative, even though the actual email that went to federal employees made no mention of it, and prior OPM guidance stated that responses to mass emails were voluntary . While some agency leaders swiftly issued guidance telling their employees not to respond, others including at the Treasury Department and the Environmental Protection Agency expressly instructed their employees to respond before the deadline, reinforcing Musk's stance that a response was required. Then late Monday, OPM issued new guidance formalizing the transfer of responsibility for the \"What did you do last week?\" request from OPM and Musk to the agencies, telling agency leaders to collect responses to the email and decide what to do with employees who didn't respond. \"It is agency leadership's decision as to what actions are taken,\" the memo stated. Where this playbook — agencies carrying out directives coming from OPM and championed by Musk — might hit a roadblock is in federal court. Last week, in response to the Trump administration's mass firings of probationary employees, labor unions sued the Trump administration , claiming that federal agencies themselves had no plans to fire employees but did so only at the direction of OPM. Their complaint points to a federal statute that states that the head of each executive department \"may prescribe regulations for the government of his department, the conduct of its employees, the distribution and performance of its business.\" In other words, the unions argue, OPM has no business telling other agencies how to manage their employees. \"OPM has, in my mind, vastly exceeded not only its authority, but any past precedent for exercising its authority,\" says Michelle Bercovici, a partner with the Alden Law Group who filed a different complaint over Trump's firing of probationary employees. \"It's definitely break first, ask questions later.\" In its opposition brief, the Trump administration denied that it had created a \"mass termination program,\" only noting that OPM had asked agencies to review probationers based on how their performance was advancing the agencies' mission. The administration insists that agencies made their own decisions about which employees to terminate and which to keep. U.S. District Judge William Alsup of the Northern District of California will hear arguments in the unions' case on Thursday. Now, unions and attorneys are bracing for far deeper cuts, as Trump moves to the next phase of the dismantling. Trump's Feb. 11 executive order directs agencies to prioritize cutting \"all offices that perform functions not mandated by statute or other law\" through a process called a reduction in force. That process moved forward a step Wednesday, with OPM and the Office of Management and Budget sending out official guidance to agencies, saying they have until March 13 to develop \"Agency Reorganization Plans.\" Those plans could mean tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of federal employees lose their jobs.

        "headline": "NPR's chief diversity officer to retire, with DEI in the political spotlight",
        "date": "2025-02-26",
        "content": "NPR Chief Diversity Officer Keith Woods announced Wednesday that he would retire after a 46-year career in journalism and 15 years at the public broadcaster, even as the issue he has championed for decades takes center stage in political discourse. Woods, who is 66 years old, presented the decision as his own.  He told colleagues he had started preparing for his retirement in 2023. He put it off after Hurricane Helene destroyed his home in Tampa, Florida last year. \"After more than four decades in journalism, I'm happy to finally be able to say the words, 'I'm retiring,'\" Woods said in a statement released by the network. \"Though the attacks on the work of diversity, equity and inclusion have taken some of the joy out of this moment.\" Woods' retirement, effective May 2, comes as the federal government and some companies back away from stated commitments to diversity, equity and inclusion. PBS shuttered its DEI office earlier this month, ousting two staffers, although it says it remains committed to telling the stories of all Americans. Because it receives federal funding, PBS said its lawyers had concluded that the move was required to stay in compliance with an executive order from President Trump. In January, he directed federal agencies to terminate all \"equity-related\" grants or contracts. Another order required federal contractors to stipulate that they don't promote such measures. A federal judge has since largely blocked Trump's orders . But Trump and his chief adviser on slashing government programs, billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, have called for all federal funding for NPR, PBS and public broadcasting to be eliminated. Republicans in Congress have submitted bills to do that. (NPR typically receives about 1% of its funds from federal sources annually, and about 3% indirectly from stations; PBS receives 16%, according to a spokesperson for the television system.) In a memo, the network's chief executive, Katherine Maher, praised Woods and told staffers and station executives that NPR would not veer from its dedication to diversity. \"NPR remains committed to supporting a diverse workforce, a welcoming workplace, and journalism that serves an audience that is representative of the American public,\" Maher wrote. After Woods leaves, NPR Vice President for Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Whitney Maddox and a deputy now report to the network's chief operating officer. Woods came to NPR after long stretches at the New Orleans Times-Picayune and the Poynter Institute, a journalism school in St. Petersburg, Fla. He is credited with securing funding for NPR's long-running podcast Code Switch and pushing NPR journalists to broaden the sources represented in their reporting. He also worked with public radio stations across the country. He found a firm ally in former NPR Chief Executive John Lansing , who died last year. Lansing declared diversity to be the network's North Star, both as a moral proposition and a business strategy. NPR increased the numbers of people of color in its ranks, though its audiences did not notably grow or shift. (NPR's digital audiences tend to be much younger and more diverse than its broadcast audiences.) In an essay last year that foreshadowed his own departure from the network, former NPR senior business editor Uri Berliner argued that Lansing's approach to diversity shut out ideological diversity at the network. That critique appears to serve as one of the springboards for U.S. House hearings that are expected to focus on NPR and PBS late next month. Woods took pains to say at a staff meeting today that the timing of his departure had nothing to do with the political moment. \"I might be doing virtual cartwheels right now, but for the context of my announcement,\" Woods said, citing \"a withering assault on the values of diversity, equity, inclusion; corporate capitulation all around us; and the treatment of diversity, equity and inclusion as a virus whose carriers must be eradicated. It makes this look like something it is not.\" Disclosure: This story was reported and written by NPR Media Correspondent David Folkenflik and edited by Deputy Business Editor Emily Kopp and Managing Editor Vickie Walton-James. Under NPR's protocol for reporting on itself, no corporate official or news executive reviewed this story before it was posted publicly."

        "headline": "What if I'm missing a form? Attorneys answer tax questions from NPR's audience",
        "date": "2025-02-26",
        "content": "For many people, filing taxes to the Internal Revenue Service is a befuddling process. There's a lot of jargon. The forms can be confusing to fill out. And there can be financial and legal penalties if you make a mistake. That's why New York-based tax attorneys Hana Boruchov and Leo Gabovich are here to help. Over the past few weeks, Life Kit has been gathering tax questions from our audience for them to answer. Some of you wondered how to handle taxes if you work remotely. Some asked what to do if you have missing tax forms. Others asked a classic question: Do I really need an accountant? Our experts weigh in on six queries. For more advice, listen to our podcast episode in the player above. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Gabovich: If you've just got a W-2, even if you have a few common deductions because you've got kids or property taxes, there's no reason to pay an accountant hundreds of dollars. The software today is so intelligent and easy to use. You could really just spend half an hour and get it done for yourself. Where I highly recommend an accountant is if you have your own business, are a freelancer or just want to have someone who's knowledgeable to guide you and set you up for success. Boruchov: Look at their qualifications — make sure they are licensed. We've had situations where people had returns done by someone who they thought was a certified public accountant, but they were in fact a nonaccredited individual. Gabovich: Enrolled agents are a great resource for people who want peace of mind. They are individuals who are qualified to be tax preparers and can represent people before the IRS. They generally charge less than a CPA. Gabovich: There's a wonderful resource known as the Taxpayer Advocate Service [an independent organization within the IRS]. If you have an issue, they will assign an advocate to you who will call you or send you a letter and let you know what's going on. They can even issue orders to basically say, \"Hey, IRS, you need to help out a taxpayer.\" Generally, you fill out a straightforward form to describe what your issue is and what you want them to do about it. They will walk you through the process and tell you which forms to fill out. If you don't know how to do it, they will help you fill out the form. Gabovich: You're supposed to report it. Without a 1099 present, the IRS is not made aware of that transaction. You can take the risk of not reporting it, but if you get audited, you'd still have to pay the tax on that $150 [plus interest and penalties]. Gabovich: It depends on where your company is headquartered. New York is particularly aggressive about it. If you are working out of state for a New York employer purely for your benefit, you still have to pay those New York state income taxes. But [many states offer credits if you are double taxed]. If you're trying to separate yourself from being taxed by the state you work in, you'd have to show why your income is not necessarily sourced from business in that state. Boruchov: There are options. You can apply for a payment plan, which the IRS calls an installment agreement . You divide how much you owe by a certain number of months, with 72 months being the maximum term. If you can't afford to pay on a payment plan, you can do what's called a partial pay installment agreement . You don't pay what you actually owe, but what you can afford to pay. Another option is what's called an offer in compromise . It's a deal with the government where you say, \"OK, I owe $50,000. There's no way I can pay for it.\" So you actually compromise on not just the tax, but the interest and the penalty. There's also an option called currently not collectible [if you can't pay both your taxes and your basic living expenses]. The amount is still owed, but you're not making payments. Each state has their own statute of limitations, but it's 10 years federally. For more advice, listen to our episode in the player above. This episode was produced by Margaret Cirino.

        "headline": "Trump White House seeks tighter grip on message with new limits on press",
        "date": "2025-02-26",
        "content": "In the White House briefing room Tuesday, the Trump administration announced its latest steps to tighten its grip on the message it sends out and the news coverage it receives. No longer would the White House Correspondents' Association, made up of news outlets that cover the White House, determine how they will share coverage of President Trump at major events where space is limited. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt told the assembled reporters the White House would make that determination instead. Leavitt said the media association previously had \"dictated\" who was able to report directly on Trump and with this move, she was returning \"power to the people.\" \"Legacy outlets who have participated in the press pool for decades will still be allowed to join – fear not,\" Leavitt said from the White House lectern. \"We will also be offering the privilege to well-deserving outlets who have never been allowed to share in this awesome responsibility.\" The television pool will not be affected, despite the president's differences with many major networks; before entering electoral politics, Trump was a frequent subject of tabloid and television attention and then a reality TV star. Press outlets \"pool\" their resources when coverage by all would be impractical; a selection of print, video, radio, online and photo news organizations alternate in doing the reporting. The Trump administration already has barred The Associated Press, a mainstay of those pools, from covering major events because it has not changed its guidance for calling the body of water between Mexico and Florida the Gulf of America, rather than the Gulf of Mexico. \"In free countries, like the United States is, leaders don't get to pick who covers them day in and day out,\" Politico reporter Eugene Daniels, the head of the White House Correspondents Association, told NPR's Ari Shapiro Tuesday evening on All Things Considered. Leavitt already has invited once-fringe figures from far-right outlets into the press room to ask questions. They include reporters for the conspiracy-minded Gateway Pundit, Steve Bannon's podcast and Lindell TV, started by the MyPillow magnate Mike Lindell . While ideological journalists have attended White House briefings for decades, she has amplified their role. \"It's surreal to watch these so-called new media people asking softball, ludicrous questions to Trump and Leavitt,\" another White House reporter said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions from a boss or the administration. \"I never thought I'd see plants in press briefings of the highest seat of American power.\" The AP filed a lawsuit over the ban, saying the White House violated its First Amendment free speech rights and its Fifth Amendment procedural rights, as it had no opportunity to appeal the decision internally. At a hearing on Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee, pushed Justice Department lawyers to reconsider the administration's stance toward the AP. Yet the judge also questioned why the correspondents' association had such discretion over who participated. The White House appears to have either taken inspiration or refuge from the judge's words - with Leavitt's buoyant announcement the very next day. She was flanked by television screens showing a map of the Southeastern U.S., each stamped with the word \"VICTORY\" in all capital letters. It showed the Gulf of Mexico marked as the Gulf of America, Trump's preferred term. The AP's refusal to change its Stylebook to reflect the president's preference, expressed in an executive order on his first day in office, led to the ban, Trump and Leavitt have said. Judge McFadden suggested that sounded like viewpoint discrimination, something the courts have found violates the First Amendment. Yet he declined the news agency's request for an emergency decree to force the administration to back off the ban. Instead, he set a hearing for March 20. Meanwhile, the president's chief regulator of broadcast media has instigated investigations of each of the major broadcast outlets – ABC, CBS, NBC, NPR and PBS – save Rupert Murdoch's Fox, which is a corporate sister of the pro-Trump Fox News Channel. In 2016, Murdoch struck an alliance of convenience with Trump. It briefly flagged, until last year when Trump once more dominated the Republican primaries. The president, in his private capacity, has filed many lawsuits against media and social media companies. The owners of ABC, Facebook, and X have each paid millions of dollars to settle lawsuits he filed against them. Paramount, CBS's corporate parent, which is seeking government approval of a sale, is weighing whether to follow their example in Trump's $20 billion suit over its interview with Kamala Harris last year. Legal observers almost uniformly say the president has no merit to his case. The administration is operating something of a pincer movement, applying pressure to all possible vulnerabilities. \"Having served as a Moscow correspondent in the early days of Putin's reign, this reminds me of how the Kremlin took over its own press pool and made sure that only compliant journalists were given access,\" Peter Baker, the chief White House correspondent for the New York Times , tweeted Tuesday afternoon. \"The message is clear,\" Baker continued. \"Given that the White House has already kicked one news organization out of the pool because of coverage it does not like, it is making certain everyone else knows that the rest of us can be barred too if the president does not like our questions or stories.\" Other veteran reporters also reacted with alarm. \"This move does not give the power back to the people - it gives power to the White House,\" Jacqui Heinrich, who covers Trump for Fox News, tweeted after Leavitt announced the White House would pick which reporters could serve in press pools. \"Our job is to advocate for the MOST access possible.\" The pressure on the press dovetails with Trump's efforts to clamp down on independent checks on his power within the executive branch. Among the myriad government officials he has dismissed are agency inspectors general and Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger, who investigates federal employees' complaints against the government . He's fired senior military lawyers, whom Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth – a former Fox star – said could be \"roadblocks\" to the White House's agenda. Under Hegseth, the Defense Department has dislodged eight news organizations from permanent work stations at the Pentagon, including NPR, and invited in seven conservative and right-wing news outlets to replace them (along with one liberal outfit, HuffPost). A Reuters defense correspondent tweeted that Hegseth was traveling to visit Guantanamo Bay to visit the new U.S.-run detention center for immigrants without a single reporter who routinely covers the military. Pentagon social media accounts painstakingly documented his comings and goings. The  \"DOD rapid response\" social media account taunted CNN after it departed its small work space and mocked the news media last night: \"Since real journalism is dead, we'll do it for you.\" Some journalists who cover the administration say they believe that veers into propaganda. And that's what is feared by many journalists over at the government-owned Voice of America, who were pressured intensely during Trump's first term. His choice to lead it, Kari Lake, appeared for the first time at the international network yesterday, according to five people there. That said, it was hardly a secret: She tweeted out a picture of the network's nameplate at the entry of its Washington, D.C. headquarters . \"Let's Get To Work,\" she wrote. Lake is a former local news anchor in Phoenix who ran, unsuccessfully, for governor and then U.S. Senate from Arizona. She has denied election losses (both hers and Trump's) and become a frequent critic of the mainstream media. Voice of America (VOA), which is funded by Congress , operates in nearly 50 languages and reaches an estimated 354 million people weekly across the globe. It is a form of soft power in that it delivers news to places where the press cannot operate freely or is not financially robust, and it models how a free press operates, incorporating criticism as well as praise for each U.S. administration. Trump announced Lake's selection as though the position involves a presidential appointment. It does not; the appointment is done by the head of VOA's parent agency, the U.S. Agency for Global Media, and approved by a bipartisan board. Confirmation hearings have not yet been scheduled for Trump's pick to lead the USAGM, the right-wing media critic Brent Bozell . At the time of her selection, Lake wrote, \"Under my leadership, the VOA will excel in its mission: chronicling America's achievements worldwide.\" That's not precisely the network's stated mission. On its website, Voice of America says it's committed to \"providing comprehensive coverage of the news and telling audiences the truth.\" As she awaits her appointment at Voice of America, Lake has taken a role as an adviser to the U.S. Agency for Global Media. In recent days, she has defended the Voice of America's existence from calls for its elimination by presidential adviser Elon Musk. She took to Musk's social media platform X to do so. \"I think it's worth getting in, digging around, fixing what's wrong, bolstering what's good, & putting out an incredible product that fulfills its mission, broadcasting the American story across the globe, & spreading the ideals of freedom & liberty,\" she wrote, linking an interview she sat for with the pro-Trump outlet Epoch Times . Another new adviser to VOA's parent agency is Mora Namdar, who worked for USAGM in the first Trump administration . She also wrote the section on the agency for Project 2025, the blueprint for governing developed by the Heritage Foundation. Trump disavowed Project 2025 on the campaign trail, but now in office, he has enacted several of its proposals . In her section on the agency, Namdar wrote that Voice of America and other U.S. owned international outlets often \"parrot America's adversaries' propaganda and talking points.\" She was part of an effort by Trump appointee Michael Pack, USAGM's chief executive for seven months in 2020, to root out perceived ideological bias throughout the network. A senior White House reporter was investigated for bias; another was demoted after asking tough questions of then U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in the wake of the January 2021 siege of the U.S. Capitol. A federal judge found that Pack violated constitutional protections. A formal investigation determined that Pack had repeatedly abused the powers of his office, broke laws and regulations, and engaged in gross mismanagement. Ultimately, interviews with more than two dozen people showed that Trump's aides at the White House and USAGM wanted the network to reflect Trump's successes and to tamp down on criticisms of him - a consistent thread of recent developments."

        "date": "2025-02-26",
        "content": "Six fired federal employees must be rehired at least through April 10, according to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), the independent federal agency that hears employee complaints against the government. The MSPB issued a 45-day stay of the terminations Tuesday evening in response to a request from the U.S. Office of Special Counsel , which had begun investigating the firings. \"I find that there are reasonable grounds to believe that each of the six agencies engaged in a prohibited personnel practice,\" stated the order from board member Raymond A. Limon. The decision comes four days after U.S. Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger argued that he had \"reasonable grounds\" to believe that federal agencies had violated federal statute in terminating six employees who were still on probationary status. The 45-day stay will allow the investigation to continue. Meanwhile, the Office of Special Counsel says it is considering ways to seek relief for a broader group of federal employees similarly fired in recent weeks. (The office is separate from the special counsels appointed by the Justice Department.) The six agencies named in the original complaint — the departments of Education, Energy, Housing and Urban Development, Agriculture, and Veterans Affairs, and the Office of Personnel Management — have five working days to provide evidence that they are complying with the order. While probationary employees lack some of the job protections afforded to career civil servants, they cannot be terminated \"at will,\" Dellinger wrote in his filing with the MSPB . Moreover, agencies must inform employees why they are being fired. None of the six had performance issues, according to the investigation. Instead, Dellinger wrote, the evidence indicates that agencies improperly used the employees' probationary status to accomplish a downsizing of the workforce, without following the proper procedures for doing so. Those fired included disabled veterans working for the departments of Education and Veterans Affairs who would receive preference in a mass layoff done legally. The Office of Special Counsel took up the case of the six fired employees after receiving a complaint, brought on their behalf by the legal advocacy group Democracy Forward and the Alden Law Group. \"These are hardworking individuals,\" said Michelle Bercovici, a partner with the Alden Law Group. \"They're people who want to make this country better.\" Democracy Forward and the Alden Law Group have amended their original complaint to include more than a dozen other federal agencies. \"We will continue to urge the Office of the Special Counsel and the MSPB to follow the law, protect all federal workers, investigate misconduct, and uphold the independence and integrity of our civil service,\" said Democracy Forward President and CEO Skye Perryman in a statement. Dellinger himself was fired abruptly by the Trump administration earlier this month. He sued, noting that under the law, the special counsel may be removed by the president \" only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office .\" A judge temporarily reinstated him while his case winds through  judicial system.
