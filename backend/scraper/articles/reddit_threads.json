            "title": "Tesla shares drop on plunging European sales, concerns about Trump's tariffs",
            "body": "Tesla shares fell almost 6% on Wednesday as data from Europe showed slowing sales last month, and investors grew increasingly concerned about President Donald Trump’s plan for tariffs.\n\nThe European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) revealed on Tuesday that Tesla saw a 40% year-over-year drop in new vehicle registrations in Europe in February, while overall battery electric vehicle sales were up 26%.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House said on Wednesday that President Trump will announce new tariffs on auto imports in the afternoon. The president has hyped April 2 as “liberation day” and “the big one” for rolling out his plan to impose heavy tariffs on foreign trading partners, but Trump hinted earlier this week that auto tariffs could arrive sooner.\n\nMovements of this magnitude have become commonplace for Tesla’s stock. On 14 separate days this year, Tesla shares have gained or lost at least 5%. Wednesday’s selloff, alongside a 2% drop in the Nasdaq, followed a five-day rally that included a 12% jump on Monday.\n\nThe trend for the year has been downward, particularly since President Trump began his second term in January, and brought Tesla CEO Elon Musk with him to the White House. Tesla shares are down 36% since Inauguration Day, after falling 28% in February, the steepest drop for any month since December 2022.\n\nFollowing the ACEA report on Tuesday, RBC analysts wrote in a note that the February numbers only represented a drop of about 11,000 Tesla vehicle registrations in Europe, and emphasized that data for the month “might not be indicative of true demand.”\n\nNew car buyers in Europe, the analysts said, “could be holding out for the Model Y refresh,” or a “new affordable model,” which they expect in the second half of the year.\n\nTesla is set to fully ramp up production of the redesigned version of its Model Y SUV next month. The company implemented partial production shutdowns at certain factories earlier this year to upgrade Model Y manufacturing lines.\n\nSome prospective EV buyers have been turned off of late by Musk’s political rhetoric and his work for the Trump administration, where he’s leading an effort to slash federal government spending, cut the federal workforce, and has said he wants to privatize many services, including social security.\n\nWilliam Blair analysts wrote in a note on Wednesday that, “pushback from Musk’s foray into politics” has led to “brand damage and even vandalism,” for Tesla at a time when the company’s supply has been impacted by its Model Y changeover, and “Chinese competition continues to heat up.”\n\nStill, the firm maintained its buy recommendation on Tesla’s stock, pointing to growth in the company’s energy storage business, and its prospects in driverless ride hailing. Musk has promised that Tesla will kick off a robotaxi service in Austin in June. The company has yet to begin production of its dedicated robotaxi, dubbed the Cybercab.\n\nAlphabet’s Waymo is already operating a commercial robotaxi service in Austin and other markets. And in China, several automakers are now offering an equivalent to Tesla’s Full Self-Driving Supervised — a premium, partially automated driving system — as standard options rather than a paid service.\n\nIn China this week, Tesla renamed its FSD system “Intelligent Assisted Driving,” according to CNEVPost, after previously branding it as “Full Self-driving Capability.” Tesla’s system in all markets still requires a human at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/26/tesla-drops-on-slowing-european-sales-concerns-about-trump-tariffs.html",

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\nNews: [Trump Says Tariffs Coming In April Will Probably Be More Lenient Than Reciprocal](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/26/trump-says-tariffs-coming-in-april-will-probably-be-more-lenient-than-reciprocal.html)\n\n[**GME (GameStop)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME&amp;p=d) **-** Reported earnings, EPS of $0.29 vs $0.08 expected. EPS beat estimates, and the company announced it would integrate Bitcoin into its treasury reserve. This confirms prior speculation tied to Ryan Cohen’s meeting with Strategy’s chairman. **This is a massive catalyst** solely based on the fact that if GME buys enough of the CC, we may see it trade at a premium the same way as MSTR does. (MSTR usually trades at a 2x valuation to the amount of CC it holds.). Volatility in the CC market could create swings in reported earnings, but makes GME easier to track price-wise. The core retail business still saw a 28% Y/Y decline in sales which is somewhat of a red flag. Biased positive.\n\n**Related Tickers:** MSTR, COIN\n\n[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&amp;p=d)\\- Second day of straight gains, with shares up 3.5% after a close to 50% selloff. I'm Interested in $290 level after failing to break above it in the premarket. EV sentiment remains mixed for TSLA going forward- despite weakness in European sales, investor sentiment appears to be shifting positive. Sales in Europe fell 40% Y/Y, and Canada’s EV rebate freeze adds regulatory actions into the mix. BYD is also close to overtaking TSLA, so I still don't consider this investible for the long-term (but it is tradable).\n\n[**DLTR (Dollar Tree)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DLTR&amp;p=d)**-** DLTR will divest its Family Dollar segment for \\~$1B to Brigade Capital and Macellum, a massive markdown from the $9B it paid in 2015. The stock reacted fairly positively on this news, mainly because DLTR has been struggling since COVID. This move is an effort to clean up the balance sheet and refocus on the core business. The market probably views this favorably in the face of tariffs - less potential exposure to Family Dollar inevitably underperforming.\n\n**Related Tickers:** DG\n\n[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&amp;p=d)\\- New energy rules in China disqualify NVDA's exportable H20 chip, threatening near-term revenue from a key market. Seen a minor selloff in NVDA of roughly $2, interested to see if we sell off more at the open. China’s energy mandates are squeezing data center hardware providers, forcing chipmakers to adapt or lose access to the market. Having the H20 not be usable is a huge blow to NVDA's revenue, as it makes up close to 10% of their revenue in 2024. More regulation or bans could further limit access to Chinese demand, other chipmakers, etc. This DOES seem targeted to have Chinese companies focus on\n\n**Related Tickers:** AMD, INTC, QCOM",

            "body": "Goal: Retire in 10 years, living modestly on dividends\n\nI began investing in March, 2020. Had about $60k in my savings account and knew nothing about investing. Got bored during Covid and started my investment journey, just randomly picking individual stocks. \n\nIn June of 2020, I read an article about Mercedes-Benz partnering up with a company that I had never heard of before to power their automated driving functions. At the time, my thought was if a company like Mercedes-Benz trusts this company, I should as well. So at the time, I randomly invested $500 in the company, NVDA. Over the next few months I would buy a few hundred dollars worth here and there. As of yesterday, I had invested a total of around $27000 over the years, and the value had grown to about $136000. I had accumulated 1,152 shares after the splits. Yesterday, I sold 850 shares for $102,000.\n\nNow, my goal is to retire in 10-15 years. This will give me 20-25 years of service towards my pension. I currently make $104k a year, which should equate to about $4500 for my pension when I reach retirement age. I have no debt and no kids. \n\nSo my goal is to re-invest the $102000 in safer ETFS with the goal of converting these to income based investments when I decide to retire at 45 or 50 years old.  I currently invest $1k per month in my brokerage, $1k a month in my 403b, $585 a month in my rothIRA, and $100 in my 457b. \n\nIf you were me, with my goal of retiring in 10 years, how would you go about doing this?\n\nMy current thought is this: Invest $50k in voo, $30k in VGT or IYW, and invest $20k in JEPQ. (I know I will owe around $13k in taxes for the gains on NVDA). Then I was thinking that I should stop investing in my 403b, and instead invest $2000 per month in additional JEPQ and let it drip. Ive run the numbers on dripcalc and even if there is no dividend growth and JEPQ stays flat, this initial $20k plus $2000 a month for 10 years should leave me with around $49000 annually in dividends before taxes, which would be plenty to live off of in SE Asia, where I plan to move. My investments in VOO and VGT could sit there and compound. With the addition of my pension and hopefully SS, I should be set for life when I reach 60 years old, with a monthly income around $7k not including the gains in my Roth and from VOO/VGT in my brokerage that I would likely convert to SCHD when I reach 60 years old as well. \n\nThoughts? Should I invest the $2k per month in VOO/VGT instead of JEPQ for the next 10 years to focus on growth and not have the tax burden?

            "title": "Tesla short thesis and the U.S. market (House of Cards) pending crash Part 3",
            "body": "This is a follow-up to my two earlier posts from the weekend and three days ago. If you missed them, I strongly recommend reading both to understand the foundation of what I’m about to share. You can find them here: [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jheaxd/tesla_short_thesis_and_the_us_market_house_of/) and [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jijwnb/tesla_short_thesis_and_the_us_market_house_of/). I’m writing this now—before more macroeconomic data drops—so this post can act as a thesis, rather than a reaction to headlines. I’ll start with Tesla, then move into the broader economic signals\n\nTo begin with Tesla: the Wyckoff distribution thesis I outlined is playing out exactly as anticipated. I argued that we’re seeing a classic Wyckoff distribution structure, and the chart supports it. $480 appears to have been the UTAD (Upthrust After Distribution), $360 marked the first LPSY (Last Point of Supply), and based on recent price action, $288 is shaping up to be the second LPSY. This doesn't necessarily mean the markdown phase starts immediately. There could be more LPSYs before a breakdown. My working hypothesis is that hedge funds and institutions are over-leveraged on Tesla, but following a string of negative catalysts, they’re now quietly distributing their positions. The strategy is to sell into retail strength without crashing the price, a process that aligns perfectly with Wyckoff’s methodology.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with Wyckoff Distribution, it's a market behavior framework developed by Richard D. Wyckoff that describes how smart money (large institutions) unload shares to retail investors before a major downtrend. Unlike accumulation phases, which precede bull runs, distribution happens near the top of a cycle and is usually disguised as a range-bound, sideways market. The price often gives the illusion of strength—breakouts, rebounds, and fake rallies—but in reality, it's a setup for the next leg down. This method is useful because it mirrors how human psychology and institutional mechanics actually work. Large players can’t exit massive positions all at once without tanking the stock—they need time, volume, and retail enthusiasm.\n\nIn Part 2, I highlighted the LPSY phase as one of the most deceptive stages in distribution. It’s when rallies fail to reclaim previous highs, and volume dries up on upward moves while increasing on pullbacks. In Tesla’s case, that’s exactly what we’re seeing. The stock is printing lower highs, support levels are weakening, and the momentum is fading. \n\nLet’s talk fundamentals. Tesla is, at the end of the day, a car company. Roughly 80–88% of its revenue comes from vehicle sales, and around $692 million last quarter—about 30% of auto revenue—came from regulatory credits. These credits are earned by selling electric vehicles and are sold to companies that don’t meet emission targets. So fewer cars sold means fewer credits earned. The rest of Tesla’s revenue comes from segments that currently don’t produce meaningful profits, and accounting for unrealized bitcoin gains is financial theater. Unless Tesla introduces a product that becomes a major revenue driver, its valuation rests squarely on its ability to sell cars.\n\nThe problem? That ability is deteriorating. As of March 26, 2025, Tesla’s global sales are showing real weakness. In Europe, Tesla’s sales dropped 49% in the first two months of the year, with German registrations plummeting 76% year-over-year. In the U.S., February sales fell by nearly 6%, particularly in the Cybertruck and Model 3 segments. China has shown slight recovery in insurance registrations, but it’s not enough to offset broader trends. While some Tesla fans claim the Model Y refresh is to blame, that’s only part of the story. The broader issue is rising competition—especially from Chinese automakers—and growing public backlash against Elon Musk’s polarizing political behavior. In January 2025 alone, Tesla’s registrations in Europe fell 45% despite growth in the overall EV market. That’s not just about product updates; it’s about consumer sentiment.\n\n[https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tesla-stock-price-sell-off-china-ev-sales-europe-byd-2025-3](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tesla-stock-price-sell-off-china-ev-sales-europe-byd-2025-3)\n\n[https://www.wired.com/story/whats-driving-teslas-woes/](https://www.wired.com/story/whats-driving-teslas-woes/)\n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/mar/08/major-brand-worries-just-how-toxic-is-elon-musk-for-tesla](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/mar/08/major-brand-worries-just-how-toxic-is-elon-musk-for-tesla)\n\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/us-latest-place-tesla-sales-plunging-elon-musk-2025-3](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-latest-place-tesla-sales-plunging-elon-musk-2025-3)\n\n[https://www.npr.org/2025/02/27/nx-s1-5311609/tesla-sales-europe](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/27/nx-s1-5311609/tesla-sales-europe)\n\nMeanwhile, there are glaring signs of weakening demand. Since October 2024, Tesla has been offering 0% APR financing and attractive lease deals—clear signs that demand is softening. Other automakers like Lexus are following suit. These deals aren’t acts of generosity—they’re admissions of a problem. In addition, Tesla recently lost access to Canada's federal iZEV rebate program, which offered $3,000 to $7,000 per vehicle. Canada froze $43 million in pending rebate payments and banned Tesla from future programs. Considering Tesla sold around 52,000 vehicles in Canada last year, this is a major blow. Without those rebates, sales in Canada will almost certainly collapse.\n\n[https://ca.news.yahoo.com/canada-freezes-tesla-rebate-payments-231257713.html](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/canada-freezes-tesla-rebate-payments-231257713.html)\n\nAs if that weren’t enough, Trump just announced a 25% tariff on all imported vehicles and auto parts, effective April 3. Even though Tesla manufactures in the U.S., Elon Musk confirmed that Tesla is not exempt—its supply chain relies heavily on imported components and vehicles from its Berlin and Shanghai factories. This is a surprise move that caught Wall Street off guard, and it forces hedge funds to rethink their exit strategy. If they were hoping to distribute slowly, they now have to accelerate. This event has serious implications for the Wyckoff distribution pattern—it may extend the LPSY phase as institutions scramble to exit without spooking the market. Tesla cannot survive as a global brand if it’s being penalized globally, and American demand alone isn’t enough to justify its valuation.\n\nAdd to that the fact that JPMorgan already cut Tesla’s price target to $120 before the tariff announcement. The fundamentals were already weakening—now the headwinds are even stronger. This changes the whole distribution schematic. I expect we’ll see a few more LPSYs before a true markdown begins, because unloading a massive position into a weakening market takes time. And we haven’t even seen the final economic downturn yet.\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/musk-says-impact-auto-tariffs-tesla-is-significant-2025-03-27/](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/musk-says-impact-auto-tariffs-tesla-is-significant-2025-03-27/)\n\nZooming out, the macro picture is flashing red. Consumer confidence is falling sharply. The latest report showed the index dropped 7.2 points in March to 92.9—far below expectations of 94.5—and the sub-index for short-term expectations fell to 65.2, the lowest in 12 years. Anything below 80 historically suggests a coming recession. Consumers are starting to pull back—holding on to cars longer, delaying big purchases, and seeking used options. Meanwhile, automakers are offering more and more incentives. This is the early phase of a slowdown.\n\n[https://apnews.com/article/consumer-confidence-economy-inflation-bd6ece8784efff205e2ab922bcb86958](https://apnews.com/article/consumer-confidence-economy-inflation-bd6ece8784efff205e2ab922bcb86958)\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/durable-goods-orders-pop-as-u-s-manufacturers-try-to-beat-trump-tariffs-f2ab7b0a](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/durable-goods-orders-pop-as-u-s-manufacturers-try-to-beat-trump-tariffs-f2ab7b0a)\n\nEven the Durable Goods report is being spun. Yes, the 0.9% growth beat the expected -0.1%, but last month’s number was 3.3%. That’s a massive deceleration. Durable goods—like cars, appliances, and machinery—are bellwethers for economic confidence. Slowing growth here suggests caution from both consumers and institutions. \n\nThat’s how distribution works. The public buys on the illusion of strength while smart money quietly exits. Tomorrow we get final GDP numbers, and on Friday, the Core PCE Price Index, personal income, and personal spending. If these show further weakness, expect institutions to continue using fake rallies to offload positions.\n\nRetail is being played. There’s a generation of investors who don’t remember 2008. They think every dip is buyable. They don’t understand how long it can take to recover from a true economic reset. And that’s why this Wyckoff distribution in Tesla—and possibly the broader market—has room to continue. The lows we saw last year may look like nothing 10 months from now. For those of you who forgot, the dips for 2008 started in late 2007 and it continued to dip until March 2009 before it started to go up. It was around 16 months of nothing but dips. \n\nDon't believe in the math or the theory? go ahead and buy the dips and contribute to this growing numbers\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jjmb9k/retail\\_traders\\_plough\\_67bn\\_into\\_us\\_stocks\\_while/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jjmb9k/retail_traders_plough_67bn_into_us_stocks_while/)",

            "body": "I have been reading this brilliant write up from u/McKoijion that beautifully breaks down high level investing. I included the write up below. I started reasoning, why would someone pick just VTI over using VT? And why someone would pick just VOO over VTI? My reasoning is (and this is my question, so please correct me) the less diversified a portfolio the more volatile it is. If an asset is volatile, it has the capacity for big losses but also big growth. I wanted to see what people thought of my reasoning. Right now I'm all in on VT and Chill, but if I was an old person with very little invested would it be wise to go all in on something like VOO? \n\nThe write up:\n* VT represents all the stocks in the world. It has a 0.08% expense ratio. If you invest $10,000 in it, you pay $8 a year. I think of it like Vanguard total world.\n\n* VTI represents all the stocks in the US. It has a 0.03% expense ratio. I think of it like Vanguard total US market.\n\n* VXUS represents all the stocks in the world minus the US. It has a 0.08% expense ratio. I think of it as Vanguard except US.\n\n* VOO is all the stocks in the S&amp;P 500. It has a 0.03% expense ratio. I think of it like roman numeral V then OO for 500.\n\n* SPY is all the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 too. But it comes from a different company called State Street. It charges a 0.09% interest ratio. But there are other fees when trading, such as a bid-ask spread. This is when you sell your stock to a middleman for $10 and they sell your stock to someone else for $10.02. They pocket the 2 cent difference on every trade, and these costs really add up if you trade large amounts frequently. But if there are more buyers and sellers, they pocket less money. You sell your stock to them for $10, and they sell it to someone for $10.002. SPY is more like the latter situation. On a big trade, you might pay $20 in fees instead of $200. So if you trade more often, SPY is better. If you trade less often VOO is better.\n\nFinally, you can combine different funds to make up other stuff. For example 60% VTI and 40% VXUS is about equal to 100% VT. A 70% large cap fund like VOO plus 20% in a mid cap fund like VO plus 10% in a small cap fund like VB is about equal to VTI.\n\nIf you want to optimize things, I suggest 60% VTI and 40% VXUS. Even easier is 100% VT. Even easier is a Vanguard target retirement date mutual fund that basically is 100% VT when you are young then adds bonds as you get older.\n\nSome people like to overweight certain thing. You might overweight a certain country, a certain company size (large, mid, small, micro), a certain industry (tech, healthcare, etc.), or a certain stock (e.g., Ford). This is a lot more work though because you have to put your time and energy into picking good stocks/sectors. Plus, there is more luck involved in picking the right one at the right time. You can make more money, but often you can lose a lot of money.",

Imagine an asset that has a volatility of 1 (so its variance is low, most daily returns are near the mean, since variance is just the avg squared deviation from the mean return).  now imagine an index comprised of 2 assets, both with a volatility of 20, but the two assets have a correlation of 0.  the index is far more diversified (its got 2 uncorrelated assets) but its volatility is much much higher.  Diversification is measuring correlations of assets, volatility is measuring returns against the mean.  Different statistical concepts.",

            "body": "Reddit reported first-quarter earnings Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations on sales and guidance.\n\nShares of the social media company rose more than 16% in after-hours trading.\n\nHere’s how the company did compared with LSEG estimates:\n\n* **Earnings per share:** 13 cents vs. 2 cents expected\n* **Revenue:** $392 million vs. $370 million expected\n\nReddit said its second-quarter sales should come in the range of $410 million to $430 million, ahead of Wall Street expectations of $396 million. Reddit provided the guidance and touched on the on-going trade dispute between the U.S. and China in a letter to investors, saying it is “well-positioned to meet this moment.”\n\n“Ever-shifting macro environments like these create both challenges and opportunities,” Reddit CEO Steve Huffman wrote. “We’ve grown through challenging times before — people need connection and information just as much in uncertain times.”\n\nRevenue during Reddit’s first quarter rose 61% year over year. Net income, meanwhile, was $26.2 million compared to a year ago when Reddit recorded a net loss of $575.1 million due to costs associated with its March 2024 initial public offering.\n\nThe company’s global daily active uniques, or DAUq, jumped 31% year over year to 108.1 million in the first quarter. Analysts were expecting 107.3 million.\n\nReddit has been a big beneficiary from Google search changes and internal site improvements, which has led to an influx of new and returning users, which it refers to as logged-out users. The social media firm has focused on site updates and features intended to convince logged-out users to create accounts and become logged-in users, which are more valuable to advertisers.\n\nThe company’s first-quarter global logged-in DAUq rose 23% year over year to 48.7 million, while its global logged-out DAUq jumped 38% to 59.4 million.\n\nIn February, Reddit said that a Google search algorithm change temporarily impacted the company’s user growth during the fourth quarter. Search-driven traffic soon recovered in the first quarter, the company said at the time.\n\nReddit isn’t the only company to weigh in on macroeconomic challenges.\n\nMeta shares rose Thursday after the company reported first-quarter earnings that beat on the top and bottom. However, the company’s advertising sales in the Asia-Pacific region came in at $8.22 billion for the first quarter, which was lower than analysts estimates of $8.42 billion.\n\nSusan Li, Meta’s finance chief, said that “Asia-based e-commerce exporters” have reduced their digital ad spending likely due to the de minimis trade loophole ending Friday.\n\nSnap reported its latest earnings on Tuesday and said it “experienced headwinds to start the current quarter,” and declined to provide guidance because of macroeconomic uncertainties.\n\nAlphabet reported first-quarter earnings last week, and said that Google Advertising sales jumped 8.5% year over year to $66.89 billion while YouTube ad sales rose 10% to $8.93 billion.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/01/reddit-rddt-q1-2025.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/01/reddit-rddt-q1-2025.html)",

Especially staples that are concerned with affordability like Walmart and McDonalds. If Consumers are pulling back spending on \"cheap\", low cart value items like a McDonalds meal then it signals to me a budget constrained, worried consumer who won't spend on higher price discretionary categories like electronics, home reno, travel, etc.\n\nThe flip side of this - other fast food companies like Domino's have been doing fine. So maybe this is also a combination of McDonald's price hikes, lack of promotions, declining affordability, and increased competition.

Users express concerns about the implications of consumers pulling back on spending at fast-food and retail businesses like McDonald's and Walmart. There is a consensus that if consumers are cutting back on spending on affordable items like fast food, it may indicate broader budget constraints and a lack of willingness to spend on higher-priced discretionary categories like electronics. Some users attribute McDonald's sales decline to factors such as price hikes, lack of promotions, declining affordability, and increased competition. Comparisons are drawn with other fast-food companies like Domino's, which have been performing better.",

            "body": "A lot of people are asking about ETFs that are available to European investors. The popular among Americans SCHD ETF from Schwab is unfortunately not available to European investors due to regulatory restrictions, as US-domiciled ETFs do not comply with EU regulations.\n\nHere is my list of ETFs that are available for your consideration and further research:\n\n**1) ISF: iShares Core FTSE 100 UCITS ETF GBP Dist**\n\nThis is a FTSE 100 (UK's top 100 companies) index fund. Another fund that tracks the same would be VUKE from Vanguard. Vanguard has low fees but only allows investments into their own funds, so you may prefer VUKE to ISF if that is your preferred platform.\n\n**2) VHYL: FTSE All-World High Dividend Yield UCITS ETF**\n\nThis is a hugely popular ETF with Europeans. There are $5.8 Billion assets under management in this investment. It is a select of high yielding dividend stocks and the top holdings are all well known excellent companies. It is a global fund so offers some degree of diversification, though it leans heavily towards US stocks with 42.8% of the ETF being US based. The number of stocks this ETF invests in is 2,192.\n\n**3) VUSA: Vanguard S&amp;P 500 UCITS ETF USD Dis**\n\nThis is an S&amp;P 500 index fund from Vanguard. It is an equivalent to the US based ETF VOO that you have probably seen all over.\n\n**4) EUE: iShares Core EURO STOXX 50 UCITS ETF EUR Dist**\n\nThis ETF seeks to track the performance of an index composed of 50 of the largest companies in the Eurozone. It is a very good complimentary piece to US based or weighted ETFs for diversification reasons. It also comes with the added fringe benefit of having a payout scheduled that operates on different quarters to most other ETFs, meaning you can emulate a monthly salaried income by incorporating this ETF (though you obviously should not invest based on pay out schedule alone).\n\n**5) GBDV: SPDR S&amp;P Global Dividend Aristocrats UCITS ETF Dis**\n\nThe objective of the ETF is to track the performance of high dividend yielding equities globally.\n\n**6) USDV: SPDR S&amp;P U.S. Dividend Aristocrats UCITS ETF Dist**\n\nThe objective of the Fund is to track the US equity market performance of certain high dividend-yielding equity securities. These are stocks that have grown their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years.\n\n**7) IUKD: iShares UK Dividend UCITS ETF GBP (Dist)**\n\nThis ETF seeks to track the performance of an index composed of 50 stocks with leading dividend yields from UK listed companies.\n\n**8) HDLG: Invesco S&amp;P 500 High Div Low Vlty UCITS ETF Dist**\n\nThis ETF aims to provide investors with a broad exposure to US companies that historically have provided high dividend yields with lower volatility. This is a conservative, risk-averse dividend fund.\n\n**9) FUSD: Fidelity US Quality Income UCITS ETF Inc USD**\n\nThis ETF tracks high quality companies from the US, which offer high dividend yields. It offers strong growth potential and lower yield than other options.\n\nThe above investments are some ideas for European investments scratching their heads at where to go with no SCHD to select. I believe that these represent a cross-section of popular dividend funds among Europeans and offer diversification across the UK, Europe and USA as well as some global exposure.\n\nThere are thousands of ETFs out there and it can be daunting to new investors. I hope that this post goes someway to separate the wheat from the chaff.",
