        "body": "Currently up ~75% on SMCI Puts. Can't decide if I should sell or hold through the filing deadline. Wouldn't kill me to lose the money, but wouldn't be particularly happy about it either. I personally think everything about the situation is shady as all hell and there may be some further scandal even if they do file the required reports.",
