        "body": "I\u2019ve been investing in nuclear energy stocks since before Covid. I suppose my reasoning for wanting to be involved in the sector was because I think it\u2019s the energy of the future. \n\nA pellet of uranium, the size of a finger nail, can create the same amount of energy as 1 ton of coal, or 150 gallons of oil. (Roughly 1 MWh of electricity) \n\nThe nuclear lifecycle creates minimal carbon emissions. And it\u2019s 0 carbon emissions while actually producing the electricity. All of the carbon emissions come from mining, fuel processing, construction, and waste management. It\u2019s on par with wind energy for lifecycle emissions without the drawback of being an intermittent form of energy. \n\nFor some context here, nuclear energy produces 3-15 gCO2/kWh across the lifecycle while natural gas produces 400-500 gCO2/kWh. \n\nAn unfortunate realization I\u2019ve come to regarding the performance of nuclear energy stocks is that they\u2019re heavily dependent on the performance of tech companies, specifically AI. Friday and today saw widespread declines across nuclear energy stocks because Microsoft noted less demand than they originally thought for new data centers. \n\nI understand industry plays a large part of the performance of energy deliverers, but it\u2019s seemed that other energy companies are at least diversified across a range of sectors. If I wanted my investments to grow or fall with AI\u2026.I would have invested in AI. ",
