        "body": "SMCI, one of several AI stocks I invested in and recommended in early 2023, saw over tenfold gains before crashing due to overly optimistic projections and accounting concerns, leading to delayed SEC filings and the resignation of its auditors.\n\nNow, SMCI faces a crucial deadline\u2014it must submit its overdue 10-K and 10-Q filings by Feb 25 to avoid potential delisting. If they file on time, the stock will surge significantly, but short sellers are pushing a bearish narrative, betting on a missed deadline and Nasdaq removal. \n\nHowever, a lack of insider selling and institutional shorting suggests confidence in an on-time filing, making the current price potentially undervalued. If you already have a brokerage account and risk capital, SMCI may present a speculative opportunity ahead of the filing. That said, this can be seen as a high-risk, short-term bet, not a typical long-term investment. However, longer-term, SMCI remains a strong AI player, uniquely positioned to benefit from demand for custom-built AI servers, especially for Nvidia\u2019s chips, while competitors like Dell and Lenovo lag behind. \n\n\n\nHigh Confidence for a Timely 10-K...\n\n\ud83d\ude80 SMCI 10-K FILING: LESS THAN 24 HOURS TO GO \ud83d\ude80\n\nThe probability of an on-time 10-K filing (Feb 25, 2025) is estimated at over 90% based on available data.\n\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udd39 NO NOTICE OF LATE FILING\n\nSMCI has historically provided 1-3 days\u2019 notice when they were unable to file on time.\n\nNo notice has been given yet about a delay for the Feb 25, 2025, deadline, strongly suggesting they are on track.\n\n\ud83d\udccc Key Insight: If SMCI were going to miss tomorrow\u2019s deadline, we likely would have already heard by now.\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 BOTTOM LINE: No delay notice = strong confidence in an on-time filing.\n\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udd39 KEY REASONS FOR CONFIDENCE\n\n\u2705 INSTITUTIONAL CONFIDENCE\n\nLarge investors reviewed SMCI\u2019s financials for the recent $700M convertible note offering.\n\nInstitutions require transparency before committing capital, indicating the 10-K is largely complete.\n\n\n\u2705 NO MAJOR ACCOUNTING ISSUES\n\nThe latest 8-K filing flagged no major financial discrepancies, reducing concerns about serious accounting restatements.\n\n\n\u2705 HISTORICAL PRECEDENT\n\nMost companies in similar situations file on time to maintain credibility with investors and regulators.\n\n\n\u2705 MORGAN STANLEY\u2019S STRUCTURED INVESTMENT\n\nMorgan Stanley issued market-linked securities (MLS) tied to SMCI\u2019s stock, meaning institutional capital is betting on its future performance.\n\nThese securities offer contingent coupon payments of 31.25% annually, reinforcing that major financial institutions see upside potential in SMCI.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udd39 IMPACT OF THE MORGAN STANLEY STRUCTURED INVESTMENT\n\n\ud83d\udccc What does this mean for SMCI investors?\n\nReinforces institutional confidence in SMCI.\n\nCould influence price action, especially if short sellers try to manipulate volatility.\n\nSignals that major financial players see an opportunity in SMCI despite recent concerns.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udd39 WHAT TO EXPECT TOMORROW\n\n\u23f3 TIMING:\n\nThe 10-K will likely be filed after-hours, around 4:30\u20135:00 PM EST.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcc9 PRICE ACTION:\n\nIf the stock dips intraday, it may be due to weak hands selling in fear.\n\nOnce the filing is confirmed, upside potential is high.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s structured investment may exacerbate volatility as institutions hedge their positions, amplifying swings both up and down.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 LONG-TERM OUTLOOK:\n\nSMCI remains fundamentally strong.\n\nOnce the uncertainty of the delayed 10-K is removed, the stock has room to climb significantly.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udd39 MINOR RISKS TO CONSIDER\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f REGULATORY SCRUTINY\n\nThe SEC &amp; DOJ investigations (linked to Hindenburg allegations) exist.\n\nHowever, no fraud or major restatements have been indicated.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f MARKET VOLATILITY\n\nStock price fluctuations may continue, but they do not affect the likelihood of the filing itself.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udd39 FINAL THOUGHT\n\nWe are very close to the finish line.\n\nIf SMCI delivers on time, expect:\n\u2705 Relief buying\n\u2705 Short covering\n\u2705 Strong momentum\n\nIf the stock drops further before the filing, it may present a buying opportunity for those with conviction.\n\nStay focused\u2014tomorrow could be a major turning point. \ud83d\ude80\n\n",

SPY owns ZERO shares of it.  i think that's a good way to determine whether the institutional players take a company seriously or not, as well as whether u should consider the direction of the SP500 when buying options on a stock",
