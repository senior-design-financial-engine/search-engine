The surge in sales underscores the company\u2019s strong execution across its AI-focused product lines and robust end-market demand.\n* Data Center revenue in Q4 grew to\u00a0$35.6 billion, posting a\u00a093%\u00a0increase from the prior year and a\u00a016%\u00a0gain sequentially. The elevated demand stemmed from enterprise AI deployments, large language models, and strong uptake of NVIDIA\u2019s accelerated computing platforms.\n* Full-year FY25 revenue soared to\u00a0$130.5 billion, representing a\u00a0114%\u00a0jump from the prior fiscal year. The broad-based strength spanned AI, gaming, professional visualization, and automotive markets, illustrating the company\u2019s diversified growth drivers.\n* GAAP earnings per diluted share for Q4 stood at\u00a0$0.89, an\u00a082%\u00a0year-over-year spike and a\u00a014%\u00a0increase quarter-over-quarter. Non-GAAP EPS also amounted to\u00a0$0.89, up\u00a071%\u00a0from a year earlier, showcasing strong underlying profitability.\n* Gross margin on a GAAP basis was\u00a073.0%\u00a0in Q4, down from\u00a076.0%\u00a0in the prior year. The decline primarily resulted from higher production costs for advanced AI hardware, although overall margins remain structurally high due to premium pricing in data center solutions.\n* The breakthrough Blackwell architecture logged\u00a0$11.0 billion\u00a0in first-quarter revenue, marking the fastest ramp in the company\u2019s history. Customer interest and initial orders indicate significant future opportunities in training and inference workloads tied to generative AI.\n* Gaming segment revenue came in at\u00a0$2.5 billion\u00a0during Q4, an\u00a011%\u00a0decrease year-over-year and a\u00a022%\u00a0drop sequentially. Supply constraints for certain products and a strategic emphasis on data center customers contributed to softer results.\n* Automotive revenue reached\u00a0$570 million\u00a0in Q4, climbing\u00a0103%\u00a0year-over-year and\u00a027%\u00a0sequentially. Adoption of NVIDIA\u2019s DRIVE platform and rising demand for AI-assisted driver features helped propel this segment\u2019s growth.\n* Operating expenses on a GAAP basis rose to\u00a0$4.7 billion\u00a0in Q4, increasing\u00a048%\u00a0from the same period last year. Elevated R&amp;D outlays for new product development and expanded infrastructure to support high-performance computing drove the expense growth.\n* Inventory levels hit\u00a0$10.1 billion, with days sales of inventory at\u00a086. Purchase commitments and obligations for inventory and manufacturing capacity totaled\u00a0$30.8 billion, reflecting management\u2019s intent to secure supply for surging AI hardware orders.\n* Q4 cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities stood at\u00a0$43.2 billion, up from\u00a0$26.0 billion\u00a0a year earlier. The robust liquidity position supports ongoing R&amp;D initiatives, potential M&amp;A opportunities, and significant shareholder returns, which reached\u00a0$34.5 billion\u00a0in FY25.\n* Management projects Q1 FY26 revenue to be\u00a0$43.0 billion\u00a0plus or minus\u00a02%, with GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins of\u00a070.6%\u00a0and\u00a071.0%, respectively. The optimistic near-term outlook reflects continuing AI momentum, though potential supply-chain risks and intensifying competition may affect long-term valuations.\n\n**UPDATED NVDA DCF AND VALUATION MODEL WILL BE POSTED AT 8PM ET**",
