        "body": "Some stocks are entering correction territory and are down nearly 10%, for example Nvidia was at 140 last week and is around 128 right now, which is roughly an 8% drop.\n\nWe\u2019ve all heard to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy when others fearful etc\u2026 etc\u2026\n\nI think it\u2019s tough to know how this will play out tbh. It could be the start of a more serious economic downturn based on some serious headwinds such as tariffs, poor consumer sentiment, and concerns about sticky inflation and what that may mean on the fed\u2019s fund rate. Conversely, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if two months from now the secular bull run is still in full force and we see indexes hitting all time highs again.\n\nWhat I do know, is that the share prices for many companies is down this week compared with last week, and personally I like to buy things when they are cheaper.\n\nIs there anything you guys are eyeing to maybe buy right now or in the very near future?\n\nIf so, what is it?",
