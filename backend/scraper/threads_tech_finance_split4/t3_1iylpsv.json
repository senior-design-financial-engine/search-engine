        "body": "Hey guys!\n\nBack at it with another DD.\u00a0 Going to keep it short as many can\u2019t read complete sentences.\u00a0 Nailed the last few DDs so hopefully I am right again this time.\u00a0 \u00a0I only post when I see a big opportunity.\n\nThe stock in play is **NIO**, the Chinese Premium EV Brand.\u00a0 Yes I know, some of you are already thinking, Chinese stocks no thanks but hear me out.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0To start, I moved to China for work and own a NIO ES7 and I am a firm believer.\u00a0\n\n**Pros:** \u00a0\n\n\\-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 New addressable markets with two new brands.\u00a0 FIREFLY (low end consumer), On V0 (middle class consumer) \u00a0\n\n\\-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ON V0 is a game changer because the current model L60 and future models are priced for the mass market.\u00a0 \u00a0\\*\\*They even have access to NIO\u2019s battery swapping stations!!!\\*\\*\u00a0 This is huge because right now there is no brand that currently offers battery swapping.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\\-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Battery Swapping technology is what differentiate NIO from their competitors because it takes 5 minutes to change a battery and you are on your way.\u00a0 \u00a0They just completed 1 million swaps during the two weeks from Chinese New Year.\u00a0 The reason why Tesla abandoned the tech is because infrastructure isn\u2019t there/too expensive, but I can tell you it works and it works flawlessly.\n\n\\-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Owns/operate the most battery charging stations in China and along highways, the Shanghai charging/swapping operations are about to turn profitable.\u00a0 \u00a0Many EV companies use their charging stations as well.\n\n\\-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Priced cheaply compared to all other EV Brands, yes because they are not selling as much but be greedy when others are fearful\n\n\\-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 US politics is a mess right now and in the near future, with DOGE and Trump creating a lot of uncertainties, I believe funds will move back to China as China is very proactive in getting investments back and is actually publicly protecting/enhancing their tech industry instead of beating them down like few yrs ago(check out Chinese equities)\n\n\\-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Their CEO mentioned that NIO is seeking to achieve profitability in the last quarter of 2025!!\n\n\\-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They will never go bankrupt as it is backed by the government, Tencent, Abu-Dhabi\u2019s CYVN Holdings , so there is essentially zero risk of bankruptcy\n\n**Cons:**\n\n\\-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Low sales numbers relative to all other brands but I firmly believe this will change as more people recognize the utility of battery swaps\n\n\\-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lots of competition in Chinese EV market, but if they break through the mass market, there will be a huge upside\n\n\\-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They still have very low sales outside China, so it is less vulnerable to tariff compared to other manufacturers, although they are expanding in Europe and have plans for Middle East.\n\n\\-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hemorrhaging cash but they aim to be profitable year end\n\n\u00a0\n\nEverything is coming together for this company.\u00a0\u00a0 While other Chinese EV stocks went up a lot already like Xpeng and LI.\u00a0 \u00a0They are just amazing cars, period. \u00a0Don\u2019t look at outdated review from youtube comparing apples to oranges.\u00a0 They are great cars.\u00a0 I firmly because the risk/reward for this is amazing.\u00a0 \u00a0Losing 30% of your investment for have a potential for few baggers sounds absolutely amazing to me.\u00a0 \u00a0It is absolutely no brainer, just look at my last DD for Palantir, I am still holding it and at a 8 bagger as of today. \u00a0\u00a0I put my money where my mouth is.\u00a0 No options for me because of the high volatility right now.   \n\nPosition is 260,000 shares @ 4.63\n\nSorry for the long post. Good luck everyone!!\n\n\u00a0",
