Not only is AWS growing but I also believe in there Amazon prime video business which is a huge business in itself when you compare it to Netflix. I also like how they\u2019re expanding into self driving cars with zoox (not sure how this will play out) and I also strongly believe there in a great position with AI agents and actual use cases to AI.",
