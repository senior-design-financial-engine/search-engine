Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Tuesday, February the 25th, 2025-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures are flat after S&amp;P 500 posts 3-day losing streak: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/24/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; Stock futures were little changed Tuesday after the S&amp;P 500 posted a three-day losing streak, with traders weighing concerns around global trade.\n*****\n&gt; Futures tied to the S&amp;P 500 inched up around 0.1%, while the Nasdaq-100 futures traded near the flatline. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.2%.\n*****\n&gt; Bitcoin prices fell below $90,000 overnight, marking their lowest their lowest level in three months. The blue chip coin is trading almost 20% below its all-time high reached on President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration day.\n*****\n&gt; On Monday, shares of key tech companies dragged down the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite to session losses. That decline among tech names also pulled the Nasdaq Composite into negative territory year to date.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cInvestors in the market more broadly, they sort of almost want to believe that the AI trade is over. They\u2019re looking for evidence [and] reasons to doubt,\u201d Doug Clinton, a managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said on CNBC\u2019s \u201cClosing Bell\u201d on Monday. \u201cFrom our perspective, the AI trade is still real. I don\u2019t think this boom is over. I still think we have two to four years to go.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Investors are also mulling President Donald Trump\u2019s latest remarks on trade. He said that tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico \u201cwill go forward\u201d after the current 30-day moratorium ends.\n*****\n&gt; Wall Street also turned its attention to key earnings reports. Home Depot reported fourth-quarter figures that beat analyst expectations, but the stock shed about 2% in the premarket.\n*****\n&gt; Nvidia is set to report earnings Wednesday after the bell.\n*****\n&gt; On the economic front, investors are turning their attention to the latest U.S. consumer confidence data due out at 10 a.m. ET. Economists polled by Dow Jones are expecting the Conference Board\u2019s consumer confidence index to show a reading of 102.3 for February, less than the previous month\u2019s reading of 104.1.\n*****\n&gt; The report comes ahead of a slew of other economic data releases later in the week, including January\u2019s personal consumption expenditures price index reading Friday. The PCE is the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation gauge.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/DAnAbe6.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx?t=sec_all)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8gxD4w6.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/KCi3wIF.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/JnMixm5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/vBrQQJN.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/lmW9OhY.jpeg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/jO82qCL.jpeg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/y4sTk4w.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/DmicvNz.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS AFTERNOON'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/LEOlRUz.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/h7b6wlG.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/08ycXNk.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5llvCdQ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/982V7Gg.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/TVBUTMu.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ntRrx9M.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/aPOGtTW.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/25/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-lly-kdp-hd-chgg.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Hims &amp; Hers Health** \u2014 Shares tumbled 22%.
