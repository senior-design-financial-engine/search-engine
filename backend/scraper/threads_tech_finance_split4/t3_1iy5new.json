        "body": "Tesla sales plummeted in Europe in January, suggesting waning demand for the US carmaker\u2019s vehicles after its billionaire chief Elon Musk stepped up his high-profile interventions in the region\u2019s politics.\n\nThe EV maker sold just 9,900 units in Europe last month, a decline of more than 45 per cent from the same period in 2024, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association. Its overall share of new car registrations fell to 1 per cent from 1.8 per cent over the same period.\n\nTesla\u2019s falling market share comes after Musk\u2019s unprecedented foray into EU politics, where he backed the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) ahead of the country\u2019s elections, sparking a backlash on the continent. Musk has also railed against the EU, which he described in November as \u201cundemocratic\u201d.\n\nThe fall came even as European consumers purchased 166,000 battery EVs for the month, up 37 per cent from a year ago. Pure EV sales grew faster than those of all other types of vehicles, while sales of cars with petrol and diesel engines fell 20.5 per cent and 26.5 per cent, respectively.\n\nThe figures include the EU, UK and other markets including Norway, one of Europe\u2019s biggest markets for EVs.\n\nEuropean sales by SAIC Motor, the Chinese state-backed carmaker that has expanded into the EU and partnered with Audi in China, rose 37 per cent to 23,000 vehicles in January, among the largest year-on-year increases in sales of any large manufacturer in the region.\n\nOverall new vehicle registrations on the continent fell by 2.1 per cent in January to 995,271.\n\nSource: https://www.ft.com/content/cdd0b5c8-2703-4fd4-9ebf-26087cac8523",

Stock is still open for speculation at this point I would say so hard to say bear or bull",
