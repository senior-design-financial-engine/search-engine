I believe (hopefully not too naively) that Apple was making a point by sharing it and gathering shareholder votes that its shareholders aren\u2019t about that bigotry life.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe\u00a0[proposal](https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_financials/2025/Proxy_Statement_2025.pdf)\u00a0drafted by the National Center for Public Policy Research \u2014\u00a0[a self-described conservative think tank](https://nationalcenter.org/about/)\u00a0\u2014 urged Apple to follow\u00a0[a litany of high-profile companies](https://apnews.com/article/companies-diversity-equity-inclusion-dei-lawsuits-753f027bb73a1035a919482427553ea3)\u00a0that have retreated from diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives currently in the Trump administration\u2019s crosshairs.\n\nAfter a brief presentation about the anti-DEI proposal, Apple announced shareholders had rejected it without disclosing the vote tally. The preliminary results will be outlined in a regulatory later Tuesday.\n\nThe outcome vindicated Apple management\u2019s decision to stand behind its diversity commitment even though Trump asked the U.S. Department of Justice to look into whether these types of programs have discriminated against some employees whose race or gender aren\u2019t aligned with the initiative\u2019s goals.\u201d",
