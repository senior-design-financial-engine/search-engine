This market is still euphoric - I guarantee many analysts have not been phased by the deep seek news - after this news every single person should have become skeptical of using forward p/e or as mentioned on Bloomberg \u201cp/e\u201d. \n\nWhat is trailing p/e vs forward p/e?\n\np/e represents the multiple that investors pay for each $ of company earnings\n\nTrailing uses last years REAL earnings, for NVDA this is at ~50 (currently about +10 or more higher than all other stocks besides Tesla- which btw is still just a car company- check their income statement. \n\nForward uses PROJECTED EARNINGS - this is your 30 p/e and if you\u2019re no skeptical about this after the deep seek news\n\nEUPHORIA\n",
