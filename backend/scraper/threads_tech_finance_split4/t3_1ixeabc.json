        "body": "Hims &amp; Hers Health\u00a0shares plunged 18% in extended trading on Monday after investors looked past better-than-expected revenue and earnings and focused instead on the disappointing gross margin.\n\nHere\u2019s how the company did:\n\n* **Earnings per share:**\u00a011 cents vs. 10 cents\u00a0expected by LSEG\n* **Revenue:**\u00a0$481 million vs. $470 million\u00a0expected by LSEG\n\nRevenue at the telehealth company increased 95% in the fourth quarter from $246.6 million during the same period last year, according to\u00a0a release.\n\nHowever, the company\u2019s gross margin, or the profit left after accounting for the cost of goods sold, was 77%, while analysts polled by StreetAccount were expecting 78.4%.\n\nIt\u2019s the second big stock drop for Hims &amp; Hers in a matter of days. The shares\u00a0tumbled 26%\u00a0on Friday after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u00a0announced\u00a0that the shortage of\u00a0semaglutide\u00a0injection products has been resolved.\n\nIn May, Hims &amp; Hers started prescribing compounded semaglutide, the active ingredient in\u00a0Novo Nordisk\u2019s blockbuster GLP-1 medications Ozempic and Wegovy. The company was a\u00a0breakout star\u00a0within the digital health sector in 2024, in part because of the success of its popular new weight loss offering. The stock climbed about 200% for the year.\n\nCompounded drugs are custom-made alternatives to brand-name drugs designed to meet a specific patient\u2019s needs, and compounders are allowed to produce them when brand-name treatments are in\u00a0shortage. The FDA said Friday that it will start taking action against compounders for violations in the next 60 to 90 days.\n\nHims &amp; Hers also offers treatments for skin care, mental health, sexual health and hair care.\n\nExcluding its GLP-1 offerings, revenue increased 43% to $1.2 billion for the full year, \u201cmeeting our previous 2025 revenue target a year early,\u201d CFO Yemi Okupe said in a release.\n\n\u201cThe success we are experiencing is a direct reflection of our improving ability to democratize access to high quality, personalized care across each of our specialties,\u201d Okupe said.\n\nNet income climbed to $26.01 million, or 11 cents per share, from $1.25 million, or 1 cent per share, a year prior. The company reported adjusted earnings of $54.1 million, meeting analyst estimates, according to StreetAccount.\n\nFor the first quarter, Hims &amp; Hers expects to report revenue of $520 million to $540 million, while analysts were expecting $497 million. Adjusted earnings will be between $55 million to $65 million for the period, the company said.\u00a0\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/24/hims-hers-health-hims-q4-earnings-2024.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/24/hims-hers-health-hims-q4-earnings-2024.html)",
