        "title": "Tesla\u2019s market cap sinks below $1 trillion as stock slumps more than 8%",
        "body": "Tesla\u2019s\u00a0postelection pop has almost disappeared.\n\nShares of the electric vehicle maker plunged more than 8% on Tuesday, pushing the company\u2019s market cap below $1 trillion and to its lowest since Nov. 7, which was two days after\u00a0President Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0election victory.\n\nThe stock has plummeted 25% to start the year, while the Nasdaq is down just 1.5%, and has slid more than 35% from its record close on Dec. 16. CEO\u00a0Elon Musk\u00a0has lost more than $100 billion in net worth over that stretch, though he is still the world\u2019s richest person, with a fortune valued at about $380 billion.\n\nThe latest slide followed a report from\u00a0Reuters\u00a0on Monday that Tesla\u2019s long-awaited upgrade to its partially automated driving systems left owners disappointed. Many users told the publication that Tesla\u2019s \u201cnavigate on city streets\u201d feature in China fell short of Musk\u2019s promises for self-driving technology.\n\nOther EV makers in China, including\u00a0BYD, offer their partially automated driving systems for free or a much lower cost. Xiaomi\u2019s popular model SU7 includes the company\u2019s equivalent technology as a standard option for free.\n\nThe report out of China added to anxiety among Tesla shareholders. Some of the concern has to do with the company\u2019s performance and some is specific to Musk, who is spending much of his time in Washington, D.C., leading President Trump\u2019s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.\n\nMusk, along with his team in Washington, has gained unparalleled access to government computer systems and taxpayer data, and the president has enabled the billionaire to lead mass firings of workers in agencies tasked with oversight of his companies, including Tesla.\n\nMusk\u2019s extremist political rhetoric and activism has led opponents in various markets to organize\u00a0protests, including at Tesla stores and service centers. Tesla\u2019s stock dropped\u00a0earlier this month\u00a0on Trump\u2019s announced plans for extensive tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China, which came alongside a decline in Tesla vehicle registrations across Europe in January and February.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, Tesla\u00a0reported\u00a0earnings and sales that missed analysts\u2019 estimates, with automotive revenue dropping 8% from a year earlier and operating income plummeting 23%. In the late January report, the company cited reduced average selling prices across its aging lineup of Model 3, Model Y, Model S and Model X vehicles as a major reason for the decline.\n\nAccording to the California New Car Dealers Association, Tesla sales dropped 11.6% in the fourth quarter of 2024 in the state, which had been Tesla\u2019s biggest market domestically.\n\nTesla shares are now about 20% above where they were trading prior to Trump\u2019s victory. Most of what remains of the rally is due to the stock\u2019s\u00a015% jump\u00a0the day after the election. Musk\u00a0was a major backer of Trump\u2019s presidential effort, contributing $290 million to Republican candidates and causes in 2024, with most of that directed at returning Trump to the White House.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/25/teslas-market-cap-sinks-below-1-trillion-as-stock-falls-more-than-9percent.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/25/teslas-market-cap-sinks-below-1-trillion-as-stock-falls-more-than-9percent.html)",
